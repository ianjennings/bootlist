<P>
antssistr asked - I don't know if this is possible but after I've done a search in Windows is there a way to print a list of the search 
results?  The only way I found to do that is with Printscreen and that wont do for the size of the list I have.

<P>
Mr User wrote - I'm about to setup a SATA 2x250GB RAID 0 system. Obviously to increase access speed.  I'm curious how partitions would be handled.  Would each partition be allocated a portion of each drive or would it simply be a contiguous area?
<P>
Ron M replied:<BR>
In a Raid 0 configuration (data striping) all files, folders, and
partitions are spread across the drives.
<P>
You realize, I hope, that while this may provide some modest gains in performance, such as during the system startup, it also substantially increases your risk with regard to disk failures and it is therefore important to ensure that you have adequate backup 
and recovery procedures in place.
<P>
In a RAID 0 configuration a failure of any of the drives results in the total loss of the content of all of the drives and there is no way
to recover anything.
<P>
Assume for the purposes of illustration that there is a 10% probability that a given disk drive will fail within the first 3 years of usage.   
With 2 such drives in a RAID 0 configuration there is a 19% probability that either of them will fail during those 3 years.

Mr. Hennings posted - I want my PC to show both the date, day, and time in the tray. I know I can do this by expanding the tray to two
or more lines but there has to be a better way.

Try Tclock2. I've used it for years and wont be without it. I use the time server at 64.236.96.53 I usually have that utility under

hollithegreat asked - I would like to be able to assign different colors to folders and different icons to some of my programs.  Does anyone know how this can be *easily* done on a XP pc?
<P>
Ayush added:<BR>
if you want to change that for many folders and want that easy then Folder Marker is very good. It adds a menu to context menu of 
folders that lets you change icons from there (Just by right clicking).

_This_ issue was planned to be done and mailed in September 2006. Fate called on me tho and without going into the details I lost
the use of my right hand via a totally weird accident and today [November 18, 2006] was the first time I was able to get back on the ballfield and type again and finish this issue.
