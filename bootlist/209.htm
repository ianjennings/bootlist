<P>
Blake complained - Windows XP, SP2, up to patch level.
<P>
I double-click the Network Connections shortcut in control panel, nothing happens.  I right click the My 
Network Places and click Properties - nothing happens.  Everything else runs fine.
<P>
Ramesh suggested:<BR>
Click Start/Run and type this command:
<P>
regsvr32 netshell

Chuck wrote - If I'm reading thru Microsoft (or other) documents, and find a registry reference, such as in 
the [following] example [of a specific key I was told to change], what's the fastest way of examining that 
entry in my registry?
<P>
[In other words, does] anybody know of a utility that lets me copy and paste (or dream on - right click?) a 
key such as "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters\", and 
open the registry key easily?
<P>
The only way I know is to:<BR>
1)  Start Regedit<BR>
2)  Open HKLM<BR>
3)  Open System<BR>
4)  Open CurrentControlSet<BR>
5)  Open Services<BR>
6)  Open Netbt<BR>
7)  Open Parameters
<P>
What a pain.  
<P>
###  Begin Example [This is where an MS KB article asks me to change a value for a key. If you have
to change multiple keys in different areas it can be quite annoying]
<P>
RESOLUTION<BR>
WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you 
to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result 
from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
To resolve this issue, use Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) to locate the following key in the registry:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters\ Change the value of 
the EnableProxy value in the preceding registry key to 0 or 1, quit Registry Editor, and then restart your computer. 
<P>
###  End Example

*** Ramesh also said a program called 12ghosts had a function that does the same with a nice interface.  
Yes, I tried 12ghosts yet again, and yes, it was fun and worked but it was just a tad too intrusive for me to 
actually post the link :)  Easy to find tho using google if you want to try it out. At least it uninstalled OK.

<P>
Grimbo inquired - Using XP Pro.  How do I reset my system so that it loads everything up without asking 
for username and password?
<P>
mark answered:<BR>
Click Start, Run and type "control userpasswords2", and click Ok. Uncheck "Users must enter a user 
name and password to use this computer" option, and click Ok. Type-in the username and credentials.

<P>
Murgi asked - I have a number of video clips downloaded from the Internet (mainly AVI files). They play 
on the computer but not on my new DVD player that supports a number of other formats. Since I want to 
watch them on the TV set, I need to convert them first  into a recognized format before burning them to 
DVD or CD. I have tried a number of programs, but some were either too complicated or too slow.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Fastest Way To Backup The Registry</font></STRONG>
<P>
KickingFox asked - For Windows 98 and Windows XP what's the quickest way to make backups of
the registry without typing any dos commands or installing a third party utility?
<P>
Ron M. answers:
To create a registry backup in Windows 98/98SE/Me use Start - Run and enter the following command:
<P>
scanregw /backup
<P>
In Windows XP you need to create a manual restore point using Start | All Programs | Accessories | 
System Tools | System Restore.
<P><BR>
*** In case you've forgotton how to go back to a previous win9X registry boot to dos command prompt 
only  and type:
<P>
scanreg /restore
<P>
Then choose the date [restore point] you want to go back to.
