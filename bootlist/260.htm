<STRONG><font color="red">1) Virus In System Restore Point(s)</font></STRONG>
<P>
Strike inquired - My virus scanner is detecting a virus in a directory that I cannot access. The directory is 
C:\System Volume Information. When I try to open it I get this error:
<P>
"C:\System Volume Information is not accessible, access is denied." Is there any way I can get in there and delete the virus file? 
<P>
Ken B. replies:<BR>
You have a virus in one or more System Restore points. Presumably you had a virus and removed it, but not before one or more 
Restore Points were created.
<P>
First of all, recognize that a virus in a Restore Point is completely innocuous and can not hurt you in any way *unless* you restore 
that Restore Point. So no need to panic.
<P>
You have a couple of choices:
<P>
1. Turn off System Restore, and turn it back on. That will delete all existing Restore Points, including those with the virus.
<P>
2. As new Restore Points are created each day, the oldest ones fall of the end of the chain. So sometime within the next 90 days at 
most, the virus-laden Restore Point(s) will disappear by themselves.
<P>
I would prefer choice number 1 to be safe, but  number 2 is acceptable, *if* you are very careful never to do a restore to a date prior 
to the one on which you removed the virus.
<P>
Bruce C. adds:<BR>
The System Volume Information is the hidden, protected operating system folder in which WinXP's System Restore feature stores
information used to recover from errors.  It's really not a good idea for you, or an antivirus application, to directly access the contents
of that folder, unless you expect to have no future use for the restore points, in which case it would be simpler just to turn off the
System Restore feature.
<P>
To clear viruses or other malware from the "System Volume Information," simply turn off the System Restore feature [Start | All
Programs | Accessories | System Tools | System Restore, System Restore Settings], reboot, then re-enable System Restore, and 
reboot one last time.  This will delete all of your Restore Points, including the corrupted one(s), and allow you start with a clean slate.

iain.henry posts - I get 2, followed by 8, followed by 3 bios beeps.  I  have tried with a boot disk, no luck.  Should I try resetting my CMOS/BIOS and if so how do I do that?  Any way to see if it is the motherboard battery?
<P><BR>
*** 99% of the time "continuing" beeps while booting are due to:
<P>
1. A mis-seated AGP video card, or<BR>
2. Bad or mis-seated RAM
<P>
It's generally NOT the bios battery. ie bad mobo batteries dont cause continuous beeping. 
<P>
Ponder said:<BR>
Anything with 8 is *normally* RAM based.
<P>
philo adds:<BR>
That's probably correct. Most bios error messages are either to do with RAM or video. So just open the machine and reseat the 
RAM and the video.
<P><BR>
*** Blast From The Past - Some of you may remember having the same problem with video card seating when VLB cards were
the talk of the town.

NickB asked - During installing my Windows XP pro. I selected to use FAT32 for format the hard disk.  Now after having all software installed, and the system runs smooth, I need to convert the FAT32 to NTFS.  I could not find the windows wizard to help me do that.
<P>
Bruce C. replied:<BR>
You can safely convert your current hard drive to NTFS whenever desired, without having to format the partition and reinstall 
everything.  As always when performing any serious changes, back up any important data before proceeding, just in case. A little advance preparation is also strongly recommended, so you can avoid any performance hits caused by the default cluster size.
