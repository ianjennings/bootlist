"One of the most rewarding aspects of the site is the e-mails I receive from people who have started 
creating from using the tutorials, from young kids to grandmothers. I am always amazed at people in their 
60's, 70's and 80's who are willing to first tackle the world of computers and the internet and then discover 
and be willing to try new avenues of creativity. It truly is rewarding for me!" [Doug H., webmaster]

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Need To Read Error Message On BSOD</font></STRONG>
<P>
kebuchan asks - Something's wrong with my system, it keeps rebooting.  I get the blue screen of death but it flashes by too quickly and I can't read it.  It starts up XP ... about 2  seconds into the startup the screen goes black, then flashes blue and then it reboots.
<P>
Will D. answers:<BR>
Right click on My Computer, select Properties and then the Advanced tab. Click on Settings under 'Startup and Recovery' and then uncheck 'Automatically restart'.  Next time your PC tries to restart you see a Blue Screen [with a stop or error message which you can use to research your problem.]  
<P>
Ron M. said in an earlier edition:<BR>
Windows XP has a default setting to "Restart on failure" and that is almost certainly what is causing [the] restarts. [There is a tweak however that one can do in order to read the error message].
<P>
Open Control Panel - System - Advanced - Startup and Recovery Settings and uncheck the 
"Automatically restart" item in the System failure section.
<P>
That will likely result in the PC locking up completely, requiring a manual reset or power-off, but you will be able to see the full text of the BSOD error message and can then investigate  the possible causes.

CJ writes - Whenever I click on the help section (contents and index) of XP, IE, OE, etc., nothing happens.  
How do I fix this?

<STRONG><font color="red">4) What Happens To Files Deleted Remotely?</font></STRONG>
<P>
dd inquires - What happens when a file is deleted remotely; where does it reside? The servers recycle 
bin is empty as is the remote client systems recycle bin from where the deletion [was done].
<P>
Ron L. answers:<BR>
Bad news, I'm afraid. If you delete a file across the network, it doesn't reside anywhere - it is totally gone. 
<P>
Phil adds:<BR>
If its a mapped drive on a network, the file is gone. Doesn't go to recycle bin. If you're connected remotely 
with something like terminal server, then the file is [also] gone.  If your connected remotely with desktop emulation software, like remote desktop, then the file would be in the hosts recycle bin (the computer
 you're connected to).

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Bootdisk For BIOS Flashing</font></STRONG>
<P>
Kay asks - I'm pretty good with PCs and I need to flash my bios so my computer can see and use larger
hard drives. My Pentium 400 currently has a 32 gig upper limit and I want to put in an 80 gig hard drive.
I was informed by my motherboard makers website that I first needed to use a *clean* bootdisk first. Can
I simply make one by going to DOS on my Windows 98 computer and doing a sys a: ?
<P><BR>
*** Yes, with some caveats. First, made sure that the bios flash program addresses your hard drive size
limit. Motherboard makers and/or national brands may have updated bios's for download, but that 
doesn't necessarily mean they will address the issue you have. For example on some older Dells
and other brands I've worked on that had your problem an upgrade flash program was available but they
didn't include an update for larger drives. 
<P>
Secondly, on the off chance that you have an older drive in your system that was doublespaced you 
certainly dont want the drvspace.bin file loading which can mess up a bios flash. You can, of course, 
delete drvspace.bin after you make the boodisk. It's a hidden file so you'll have to use the attrib
command from the windows\command folder to unhide it first with the command attrib -h -r -s drvspace.bin
then you can delete it. Or of course you can delete it using windows explorer if you have [view all file types
set]. 
<P>
Thirdy. Make sure  you use a brand new floppy disk and that your A: drive is clean and working properly
before you start. Blow it out with compressed air and/or do a cleaning with a cleaning kit first if it hasn't been
used in a while. 
<P>
Fourth. Dont ignore the backup option for your current bios that should come with the flash utility. 
<P>
Fifth. Read the docs. If they say they recommend that you set your bios to defaults before you flash then
do it. If you have your hard drive parameters set manually tho ie sectors, heads, LBA, Large, etc. record 
them first. 
<P>
Six. Generally, its usual to put the utils you need to flash on the bootdisk. If you use an MS win98
bootdisk tho made by using the sys a: command you'll already have 376,000 bytes used. A better
flash bootdisk is available however that only uses 119,000 bytes and is pretty much the standard for
booting up with these days before you flash. 
<P>
It's a disk I made four years ago and many large motherboard makers like Abit have it available for
download:

<P>
Download the file, put a brand new floppy disk in your A: drive, then click on the file which will create the
disk.
