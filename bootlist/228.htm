<STRONG><font color="red">1) Utility To Check Drive Fragmentation For Win98</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mr. Davis asked - I have Windows 98 SE and when I go to defrag it doesn't show me how much the drive
is fragmented like it did in Windows 95. Am I missing something? 
<P><BR>
*** Use CrackUp to see in advance if you need to defrag or not:

<P>
When you run the program you'll get a report on the percent fragmented per drive selected. If it's less 
than 5% I probably wouldn't bother. In any case delete all your internet cache and temp files before you
defrag to avoid wasting time and to do a proper job. 
<P>
Also set the screen saver to None and do it in Safe Mode if it keeps stalling in standard windows even
with your background apps turned off with msconfig or the third party app EndItAll. And use the defrag that
comes with WinME as it's much faster:

Subject: BootLIST 227 Item 3) Problem Installing MS Updates
<P>
Recently I have encountered several PCs which do not update (all updates are shown as 0 KB 0 minutes) - I don't know what causes this problem. For most, I found running the following batch file did the trick:
<P>
echo on<BR>
net.exe stop wuauserv<BR>
cd /d %windir%<BR>
rd /s softwaredistribution<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\qmgr.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\qmgrprxy.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\wuapi.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\wuaueng1.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\wuaueng.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\wucltui.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\wups.dll<BR>
REGSVR32 %windir%\system32\msxml3.dll<BR>
net.exe start wuauserv<BR>
net.exe stop cryptsvc<BR>
rename %windir%\system32\catroot oldcatroot<BR>
rename %windir%\system32\catroot2 oldcatroot2<BR>
net.exe start cryptsvc
<P><BR>
*** Item 3, Issue 227 was very basic, but it's easy sometimes to overlook the basics. In addition to your
batch file I also have this to refer to:

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Cant Replace Corrupt Win98 Files While In Use</font></STRONG>
<P>
michael.a. posted - When my computer starts windows it comes up with a message box saying that
the following system files are corrupt :
<P>
DDEML.DLL<BR>
MCICDA.DRV<BR>
WINASPI.DLL
<P>
Windows still is running fine and I have replacement files for them but I cant replace them because they 
are in use. I tried using SFC and it doesn't work. I have windows 98 SE.
<P><BR>
*** Try replacing them after booting to Safe Mode, or, after booting with a basic bootdisk. If you use a
bootdisk windows has no chance of running so they cant be in use. Still, even if that works, you may have
to re-register them as two of them are windows dlls. 
<P>

<P>
Regarding SFC - System File Checker in win98 I too haven't found that utility to be of much use. 
<P>
Jim B. said:
<P>
Sometimes the tools below will find files which they are unable to delete because they are in use.
<P>
A program called Copylock, here:
<P>
<A HREF="http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=misc">http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=misc</A>
<P>
Can aid in the process of replacing, moving, renaming or deleting one or many files which are currently 
in use (e.g. system files like comctl32.dll, or virus/trojan files.)
<P>
Another is Killbox, here:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.downloads.subratam.org/KillBox.zip">http://www.downloads.subratam.org/KillBox.zip</A>
<P>
A third which is a bit different but often very useful is Delete Invalid File, here:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.purgeie.com/delinv.htm">http://www.purgeie.com/delinv.htm</A>
<P>
Which handles invalid/UNC file/folder name deleting, rather than the in use problem.
<P><BR>
*** The above utils should work in both win98 and XP.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) USB Or Firewire For External Drives</font></STRONG>
<P>
Advid wrote - I want to add an external hard disk and external DVD writer to my XP PC.  If these have a 
choice of either USB2 or Firewire - does one outweigh the other? Is firewire connection the same as USB 
(Win XP home) - ie  Do I just plug in and Win will see the 'extra' drives.   Or do I need any extra 
software/CD to install it
<P>
Oxford Systems answered:<BR>
Look for some to disagree on this but current generation Firewire would be the preferable to USB2. 
While the theoretical transfer rate of USB2 is faster (480mpbs vs. 400 mbps for Firewire), in practice 
Firewire is a more efficient protocol with faster access and transfer rates in the real world.
<P>
If your system has Firewire ports, you can just plug it in. Firewire support is built into Win XP. Be aware that 
Win XP SP2 upgrades "broke" Firewire and caused some very slow transfer rates. There is an 
explanation and a fix for it here: 
<P>

<P>
Edward W. T. adds:<BR>
Re USB2 or Firewire, it depends.  If you intend to connect the external drive to a variety of machines then USB2 is more 'universal' with respect to ports.  Firewire ports can vary between machines to none to 4 
pin or 6 pin.  Firewire with a 4 pin port will require a separate power supply for the HDD
<P>
With regards to software, if you are using WINXP SP2 and a motherboard with USB2 and firewire ports 
built in the WINXP native drivers will be sufficient.  If you are connecting through an add in card then the
card supplier may require special drivers to be installed.
<P><BR>
*** External drives are used for additional storage and data backup, and are designed for portability
and use on other systems when you need to get data back.  To that end I'd suggest going with a USB
as most all PCs these days have USB but only a small percentage have Firewire.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Recommended First Step After Installing XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
Will proclaimed - I just installed Windows XP version 2 from the new Microsoft CD on a new hard drive. 
The geeks at work said the first thing I should do is "tweak it up" to make it run better. I dont have a 
problem with the way it runs now and it boots up nice and fast compared to my old XP.  
<P><BR>
*** I'm not sure what they actually mean by "tweak it up", tho I have my suspicions.  The VERY first thing
to do, assuming you are not behind a hardware firewall like your inhome router, is to make sure you
have a firewall running, at least for inbound traffic. So, if you have a firewall program on CD or saved to 
CD, install it. If not, then IMMEDIATELY enable or make sure the built in XP firewall is running. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=283673">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=283673</A>
<P>
And I'd certainly would not mess with system aka "tweak it up" if I was already happy with how it was
running.
