<STRONG><font color="red">1) Deleting Files With Invalid Filename Characters</font></STRONG>
<P>
jk53110 asks - I have several files that have the # sign in the file name. I did not name these but some one 
else at work did. How she was able to do it without a warning window is beyond me. At this point in time, 
when I try to delete, cut or rename the files, a message comes up stating an invalid file name. How can 
I delete these files?
<P>
Detlev Dreyer reported:<BR>
It's no problem to rename files using the '#' character, at least under German WinXP. And it's no problem 
to delete them.
<P>
Try this:<BR>
Start | Run: CMD<BR>
Change to that particular directory and delete these files, ie. [to] delete the file "my#file.doc":
<P>
DEL my?file.doc    (note the character '?' replacing '#')
<P><BR>
*** The # may actually just be the best windows guess as what may be a "invalid" character in the 
filename as the real # character is not a problem, at least on my pcs.  Or, sometimes you may just see a 
space in a filename but then try to delete the file using the space key still no go. That's where the ? 
wildcard comes in handy. The ? wildcard is more powerful than the * wildcard as it addresses _any_ 
character even invalid ones.

John F. emailed - [As a follow up to your last issue:] A really excellent Explorer alternative which has both 
a free "lite" version as well as a shareware version is xplorer2:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.zabkat.com/x2lite.htm">http://www.zabkat.com/x2lite.htm</A>  for the lite version.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.zabkat.com/index.htm">http://www.zabkat.com/index.htm</A>  for the shareware version.

Paul A. C. also pointed to another good one:
<P>
I have hated windows file managers since the beginning (except the old Dosshell - nothing better?). I 
have tried all of them including Power Desk in all it's earlier forms (multiple companies). Actually Power 
Desk was very good in the past and still offers many of the best features, but the reader is correct, with XP 
the app is incredibly slow.
<P>
I looked around and discovered Magellan Explorer 3.0 by Enriva. It may not have as many bells and 
whistles, but is very fast and stable. Check it out at:

*** Thanks. Often folks dont need or even want all the bells and whistles. Often, simple is better.

Mark from Peabody Coal wrote - I know you have to hit F8 to get into safe mode in Windows ME but when
I try it still goes to the regular desktop after some errors I want to try to get rid of. Is there any other way to
get to safe mode? 
<P><BR>
*** For Windows 98 the standard way is to hit F8 repeatedly while the pc is booting up to get the menu. For WinME the standard way is to hold the CTRL key down while booting. However, holding the CTRL key 
down for Win98 "should" also get you the menu.  In other words, if F8 is not working, try the CTRL key 
option for either OS.
