<STRONG><font color="red">1) Mouse Driver CD. Is It Needed?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mrs. Gruber phoned - Hi Ed. I needed a new mouse and just bought a Belkin PS/2 with a scroll wheel
for ten dollars. I shut my computer off, connected it, and rebooted. It works devine. My question is - Do I 
also need to install the software  that came with it on the supplied CD? 
<P>
My Brother-In-Law who works as a programmer for ATT said I _must_ always install the CD for any
appliance I buy. Is this true?
<P><BR>
*** No, not true. If the mouse is working fine with the built in Windows drivers then let it be. No need to add
an icon to the system tray, add more background apps, or add features you dont need or want. In fact,
just the other day I tried out a new mouse, and for the heck of it put in the special software to see what
would happen. 
<P>
While the software installed perfectly fine, I lost the fast pointer speed I really like. There was no way to
get the fast speed back, even if I set the speed to the far right in control panel | mouse | motion | pointer
speed. I had to un-install the software to get back to the settings I like. 
<P>
So, if you're happy with the default windows drivers, let it be. If you need additional functions for, lets say, 
a complicated multi-button mouse, then you will need to install the drivers.

<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/bootlist/240.htm#2">http://www.bootdisk.com/bootlist/240.htm#2</A>
<P>
I suggest that he check out Microsoft Shared Computer Toolkit for Windows XP:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sharedaccess/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sharedaccess/default.mspx</A>
<P>
One great thing about this solution is - ITS FREE!  I have used it with great success in schools and places 
that need kiosk computers.

<P>
Warren W. and Cavstevie emailed - in reference to Re:  Issue 240#4 - Hard Time Getting to Safe Mode:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/bootlist/240.htm#4">http://www.bootdisk.com/bootlist/240.htm#4</A>
<P>
Try this:
<BR>
Click on Start, then click on Run<BR>
Type in msconfig, then click on OK<BR>
Click on the BOOT.INI tab<BR>
Under the Boot Options section, check the box next to /SAFEBOOT<BR>
Click Apply<BR>
Click OK, then restart when prompted.
<P>
This should boot the computer directly into Safe Mode.  Be sure to change these settings back when 
done, otherwise the computer will boot directly into Safe Mode everytime!

<STRONG><font color="red">4) CDrom Drive Not Detected In Bios</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mr. Romaine asked - If the BIOS on my newly built or older PC cant find or detect the CDrom drive is there 
a list of the reasons that my Computer cant find my cd rom drive?
<P><BR>
*** Yes. Bad cable, bad drive, bad power connector, bad bios due to a bad bios flash, bad cdrom drive firmware due to a bad firmware flash, incorrectly set jumpers, or it just cant get along with the other drive on the cable, if any.
<P>
Try putting the CDrom drive on the Secondary IDE channel by itself as a first step. Also, make sure that
the Secondary channel is ENABLED in the bios. Also, if trying to boot from a bootable CD, make sure you have the bios set to AutoDetect for the location of the CDrom drive.

phurrballs posted - Anyone know where you can download Excel (to use on XP) FREE?
<P>
Mike answered:<BR>
If you want to try Excel out, there is a 30 day trial version from Microsoft you can download:

You have to register, but it is a nearly identical Excel clone graphically, with many of excel's features.
<P><BR>
*** Of course, there is always Open Office as a free option which I should mention or I'll get a number of "reminder" emails :)  However, please note that many people complain that open office just works too 
slow and they often say it's worth just paying for MS Office. Other people say it runs better than MS Office.
I suppose it depends on your specific pc.
