<P>
joseph asks - Every time I open regedt.exe it close itself in 6 or 8 seconds.  I need help to stop it from 
closing itself.
<P>
dave also asks - I'm having the same problem and have run virus check and spybot.  Have same 
problem with task manager.  Appears briefly, CPU usage icon appears in tray but disappears when I 
place mouse pointer over it.
<P>
Malke answers:<BR>
You both have computers infected by at least one virus. Unfortunately, the ones that produce those 
symptoms immediately break any av installed. The infection could happen if you didn't have any av
installed, had an older antivirus version, weren't updating its definitions or didn't renew your subscription. 
The usual way to deal with this is to:
 <P>
1) Take the infected machine off the Internet and any lan immediately.
<P>
2) From a different, clean machine download Stinger:<BR>
<A HREF="http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/">http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/</A>
<P>
And run it in Safe Mode. Stinger is a limited virus checker, but its advantage is that it is stand alone and 
doesn't need to be installed.
<P>
3) Hope that Stinger cleans up the machine enough to be able to reinstall your av or install a new, current 
one. Update its definitions and do a full scan.
<P>
4) Continue the cleaning process by removing any spyware with Spybot Search & Destroy:<BR> 
<A HREF="http://www.safer-networking.org">http://www.safer-networking.org</A> and Ad-aware <A HREF="http://www.lavasoftusa.com">http://www.lavasoftusa.com</A>.
<P>
Be sure to update these programs before running them. These programs are free, so run them both 
since they complement each other.
<P>
You may also want to run the latest CWShredder from:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/index.html">http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/index.html</A>
<P> 
Always read the instructions before running a spyware removal tool. It is best to run antivirus and spyware removal tools in Safe Mode.
<P>
5) After you've installed your full-featured av, updated its definitions and run a full system scan.
<P>
6) Make sure you are running a firewall.
<P>
7) Go to Windows Update and apply all security patches for your operating system. Do not install drivers 
from Windows Update.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Scandisk Is Haunting Me</font></STRONG>
<P>
Arsalan posts - It looks like for some reason whenever I start my WinXP, it scans the hard disk. I want to 
disable this option, because it takes too long and it does it whenever I start my PC.
<P>
Note : windows is properly shutdown, but still this scandisk.
<P>
eckrichco suggests:<BR>
Go to run, type cmd  In cmd type CHKDSK C: /d   Or try CHKDSK C: /REVERT
<P>
Try one at a time after you've restarted computer. By the way,scandisk doesn't exist in xp! 
<P>
Hilary K. suggests:<BR>
There is no scandisk in XP.  It's been replaced with chkdsk.  See this knowledge base article:
<P>
Chkdsk.exe or Autochk.exe starts when you try to shut down or restart your computer:<BR>

<P>
OrmesbyJohn asks - What's a good (free preferably) text to speech software?
<P>
Mike suggests:<BR>
I think for "good" (if there is such a thing), you're going to have to pay, but Speakonia is free:

<P>
Trent SC wrote - Am I right in thinking that one of the qualifying operating systems for an XP Pro upgrade 
CD is Windows 98se?
<P>
Rick answers:<BR>
Yes, you are right. WinXP Pro upgrade will work on Win98, Win98SE, WinME, WinNT4, Win2000, and 
WinXP Home. You can also use any of those product CD's as a qualifier for a clean install. A Win95 disk 
will also work for the clean install, though you would not be able to upgrade a Win95 installation.
