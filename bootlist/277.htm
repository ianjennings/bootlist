Rolf wrote - I have just installed an ASUS NM2-E motherboard with Win2k and a Western Digital 250GB SATA-2 250GB disk and everything works fine, except when I try to use some IDE (FAT32) formatted disks from my old computer. (Win2k only recognizes 
130GB out of the 250GB, I installed Win2k on a 20GB NTFS partition.)

<P>
benb inquired - Is there any way to apply/copy the folder view options (file size, type, etc) from one folder to all it's subfolders?
<P>
I'm aware of the Windows Explorer Tools | Folder Options | View ability to apply the current folder view settings to ALL folders, but I 
only want to apply them to subfolders since I'd like to use one view for a hierarchy of photo folders, another for a hierarchy of audio folders.
<P>

I've written a script that will apply all the view customizations you can set to all of a folder's subfolders.  Click the link below & save to your computer.  The zip file contains a readme file & the script itself.

You can select a folder & configure its view settings, then those are set to be inherited by all subfolders (you have the option of 
saving or wiping out current saved views) .  You can set a default for My Pics, another for My Music, and then a more generic default 
for  My Computer.  The inheritance settings are separate from the folder view itself  -- for example, you can set a non-grouped view to 
be the default inheritance for My Computer, then return My Computer to its standard 'group by type' layout after running the script 
without affecting the default view you have set.

Mr. French asked - Windows 98SE doesn't boot but I can boot to dos is there an anti-spyware program that works in dos as I believe Windows is not starting because of spyware.

Brian questioned -  This is popping up on a pc in the morning. Is it a real Windows message or a virus or joke? "You May be a victim 
of software counterfeiting. This copy of windows is not genuine. Click this balloon to resolve now."   
<P>
elchema responded:<BR>
Is not a virus, using Windows Update you installed "Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications" that validates if you have a genuine 
copy of windows, check out his link:
