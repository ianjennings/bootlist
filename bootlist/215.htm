<P>
aunt.jemima inquired - Is it "He walked over toward the computer" or is it "He walked over towards the computer"?
<P>
The microsoft word grammar checker doesn't complain either way.
<P>
Blinky the Shark replied:<BR>
<P>
These two words are interchangeable, but "toward" is more common in the U.S. and "towards" in
the U.K.  [copied from link below]

The point is that when you remove spyware very often some damage remains which may result in a
loss of internet connectivity.  Before you reinstall/format/whatever try these, but only try them AFTER
you've tried everything else, including removing all your networking protocols eg Client for MS Networks,
TCP/IP, Dial Up Adapter etc., rebooting, and reinstalling them.

BL wrote a comment in regards to the Ghost article in the last issue - 
<P>
I support Ghost for Symantec. Here are a couple [of other popular] links that [your readers who use Ghost] 
might find useful:

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Microsoft Anti-Spyware BETA</font></STRONG>
<P>
Charlie E. asked - I downloaded and installed Microsoft Antispyware (Beta) recently.  I have noticed that 
if the computer is on,  then around 7:45 PM GiantAntispyware will automatically dial up and go online.  
After a search it showed up as Part of Microsoft Antispyware.  However, I cannot find any place to disable 
this little irritating gadget to keep it from dialing out.   Any one have this problem, Or is GIANTAntispyware 
some other program and not part of Microsoft Antispyware?
<P>
Toolman Tim explains:<BR>
The MS AntiSpyware program is Giant AntiSpyware - MS bought it, and is relabeling it, and providing it 
with their name. So yes, that *is* what is trying to dialup. The settings of the program are set to update 
automatically, just like most AV programs.
<P>
Click on Options, Settings, Autoupdater [to set your update preferences].
<P><BR>
*** Note that the MS anti-spyware program may still have a problem keeping time, but again, its BETA. 
I cant blame Microsoft for getting into the anti-spyware business as many techs who fix computers are
reporting that 50% of their service calls over the last year or so are spyware related. 
<P>
Why does spyware cause so many OS operational problems?  Well, think about it, do you think that the
companies who sponsor this garbage care about the problems it may cause?   Do you think they 
properly test it before they bundle it with that application you just downloaded? The best defense is to 
boycott applications that contain spyware. Read the docs/eula carefully before you click I Agree, Next.

Every now and then take a piece of cardboard box, turn your keyboard upside down and using some 
force, tap each corner of the keyboard on the cardboard. Repeat several times.  You may see staples,
nail clippings, broken bands from your kids braces, and frankly some stuff that can be a tad scary and
hard to ID. This is the stuff that often causes stuck keys or keys not to work anymore, or even shorted out
keyboards. 
<P>
As an aside, when blowing out the inside of your pc with a can of compressed air, be sure to use the 
straw that comes with the can and insert it in the holes of the power supply from both the inside and the
outside and let it rip. The power supply has a circuit board where dust can totally build up underneath 
which can prevent it from being properly cooled itself, even tho it has it's own fan. You may even want to 
take the pc outside to do this if you've never done it before. 
<P>
While you're in there simply blowing out the cpu fan is not enough. Point the straw to also clean out the
cpu heatsink as the fan often compacts dust between the cooling blades.
