<STRONG><font color="red">1) Do I Need Both .net 1.1 And 2.0?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Vince asked - So far I have not needed .net for any programs I use and have not installed it. However at work we purchase 
computers with .net 1.1 already installed from the manufacturer.
<P>
When you use windows updates to update to .net2.0, .net1.1 remains.
<P>
So my question here is this. If I have a computer with no .net and need to install it do I need both or just one version. If I put 2.0 will it handle 1.1 requests or do I need both?
<P>
Rock said:<BR>
2.0 is distinct from 1.1.  Some programs need 1.1.  So the answer is it depends on the program.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) BIOS Locked OEM Windows</font></STRONG>
<P>
JoeD posted - The motherboard has died on my PC and it had a OEM version of XP home.  Can I change the motherboard and use 
the same licensed copy of XP that came with my PC?
<P>
Carey F. answered:<BR>
Only if you replace the motherboard with the exact make and model as the original.  Otherwise, the OEM license is no longer valid 
and you'll need to purchase a new Windows XP license.
<P>
Ron M. says:<BR>
If your OEM version of Windows XP is BIOS Locked (SLP) then you must replace the board with one from the same computer
manufacturer/assembler that produced the original computer.
<P>
BIOS Locked OEM versions are self-activating so if you had to activate your OEM Windows XP over the Internet when you first purchased the computer then it is almost certainly _NOT_ a BIOS Locked version.
<P>
Replacing the motherboard on a computer with OEM Windows XP that is not BIOS Locked is a bit of a grey area, as the End User License Agreement does not actually define what comprises the "computer".  Other than the licensing concerns, replacing the motherboard with one that is not from the original manufacturer/assembler will require you to do a Repair Install as per the 
instructions at:

Tim S. added:<BR>
Not legally, and probably not at all.
<P>
Your OEM version of XP is licensed only for the first computer it's installed on. It cannot be transferred to a new computer. Ultimately
it's the OEM, not Microsoft, that determines what defines a new computer. And they generally say that a new motherboard - 
especially one not purchased from them - makes for a new computer.
<P>
Even if you ignore the EULA, your OS is very likely locked to the BIOS on your current motherboard and wont work with another MB
[that you buy from a third party].

Martin R. wrote - I just installed 4GB of RAM in my computer, but when I checked Windows XP Pro, it reports 2.5GB.  [But]  it sees that there are 4 DIMM of 1GB each installed. How can I make [sure] Windows [is really] recognizing all the RAM?
<P>
Ron M. said:<BR>
Use Start | Run | MSCONFIG and go to the BOOT.INI tab and click on the Advanced Options... button.   In the Advanced Options 
window make sure that the checkbox for the /MAXMEM= line is clear and that there is no value in the databox for that line.
<P>
Newt O. adds:<BR>
The amount of RAM reported by the System Properties dialog box and the System Information tool is less than you expect after you install Windows XP Service Pack 2:

jerstraw inquired - Are there any freeware, shareware, or any purchase programs that will convert rm/ram and rmvb files to another format such as avi, mpg, etc. I've found some that will covert to rm, etc but not any that will convert from rm to a more popular format.
