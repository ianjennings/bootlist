<P>
b11 wrote - Under XP, restore points over 90 days old are automatically deleted. How can I stop that from happening?
<P>
Ken B. replied:<BR>
You can't. Even if you could, restore points anywhere near that old are almost never of any use.  Don't 
think of System Restore as a substitute for a general backup scheme. It backs up the system only, not 
your data, and is suitable for getting you out of trouble by taking the system configuration back a few 
days to a point before a problem started. It really isn't meant to do any more than that.
<P>
Bert K. added:<BR>
The amount of days restore points are held can be increased or even decreased via the registry. As 
pointed out, this is not a good idea. Restoring a system back more than a week or two could very well 
cause more trouble than it worth. The amount of  days restore points are held will also depend on the 
size of the restore points and the amount of available disk space set to hold them.

<P>
Ernie L. posted - I don't use automatic updates (I have them turned off).  Every time I boot up, I get that little warning balloon by the system tray that tells me my system might be at risk.  How do I get rid of that 
warning? 
<P>
Torgeir B. replies:<BR>
Control Panel/Security Center, click on the [Change the Way Security Center Notifies Me] link in the left 
pane.
<P>
If the [Change the Way Security Center Notifies Me] doesn't stick when you reboot, or you want to disable 
the Security Center totally, you can do the following:
<P>
Start | Run | services.msc
<P>
Find "Security Center" in the list, double click on it, set "Startup type" to Disabled. Frequently asked 
questions about Windows Security Center:

<P>
lbbss asks - Is there a way that I can get my hotmail emails send to yahoo or visa versa?   I also have a 
regular ISP.    I am able to get my hotmail and regular email account all in outlook express at my home computer.   At work I don't want to use outlook because I don't want to store my personal emails on my 
work computer.    It would be great if I could get my yahoo and personal email forwarded to my hotmail account (or visa verses) .   Or at least notify me that I have email in my other accounts.  Any way to do that?
<P>
cygnian suggests:<BR>
There are probably some paid services that will do that, if you MUST have all your email forwarded to 
one email account. However, consider a free program called EPROMPTER. You can configure several different email accounts (Yahoo, Hotmail, not Netzero yet), and it will retrieve all your emails, securely. 
You can download and read offline, as well as compose offline, then have it sent next time you're online.
