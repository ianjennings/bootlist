<STRONG><font color="red">1) Cant Stop XP Chkdsk From Running</font></STRONG>
<P>
Java.King.not posted - While in the middle of downloading a file from the internet my PC became 
unplugged. Since then, everytime I boot my system it runs the chkdsk command on one of my partitions. 
It always passes the chkdsk command successfully but for some reason it will not set the drive from 'dirty' 
to 'clean'. Hence each time it runs the chkdsk command on boot. 
<P>
I could of lived with this, but is this is now stopping my defragger tool from running. Does anyone know 
how to set the drive status back to clean to stop the chkdsk utility from running?
<P>
Mary answers:<BR>
Chkdsk does not correct errors without the /F parameter. Go to Run, type CHKDSK  /F and say yes to run 
at next boot. Then reboot and let it run and fix the errors. (note the space before the /F)
<P><BR>
*** A reminder to also set the drive letter you want to be checked, if applicable. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.fsref.com/pr/dosxp.htm">http://www.fsref.com/pr/dosxp.htm</A><BR>
You'll have to scroll down to chkdsk.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Boot Drive Changed To F: After XP Reinstall</font></STRONG>
<P>
ross asks - I've just reinstalled XP Pro with SP2 and find my [Primary/Boot] Drive letter is F, not C. I 
tried comp management but it says it cant change the letter of the boot drive. Is there a way around this 
please? 
<P>
PJB answers:<BR>
Do you have a multi-format memory card reader fitted? If so, disconnect it, reinstall XP, and it will come 
up as drive C. Then reconnect the card reader.
<P><BR>
*** This is pretty much the same deal I've talked about many times. It's often best to install an OS with your
perifs turned off or disconnected. Printers, scanners, external drives, cameras, etc., etc., etc.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Six Foot SCSI Cable Doesn't Work</font></STRONG>
<P>
Les wrote - I am using an external SCSI with two drives in the case. The system works fine when it is 
attached to a three foot cable, from the external case to the computer. But when I change the cable to six 
feet I see the drives but I seldom get the SCSI Bios acknowledgement. If I do get the acknowledgement I 
still cannot see the drives in Windows Explorer. 
<P><BR>
*** Perfectly normal. SCSI devices have ALWAYS liked short cables. Heck, some of the old external 
SCSI cables I have are only 1 1/2 foot long. Many of you may remember your first scanner and how short 
the cable was :)  Yes most of the older scanners were SCSI ie you had to put that special card in, 
remember?

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Disk Space Doesn't Increase When I Delete Files</font></STRONG>
<P>
Melissa complains - Whenever I delete files in XP the disk space does not increase it stays the same. I
eventually run out of room on my somewhat small disk drive any clues?
<P><BR>
*** 90% of the time, from experience with onsite service calls, I find it's due to folks using Nortons 
Protected Recycle Bin. Disable that if you have it running or just clean it out.  The other ten percent of the 
time it's due to one or more of the niggles delineated on this page:

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Anything Wrong With Having Two Firewalls Running?</font></STRONG>
<P>
LarryLOOK posted - My Belkin router has a firewall which is enabled.  Now I have sp2 with firewall turned 
on.  Anything wrong with having two firewalls running?  Any advantages to this.  So far haven't noticed any problems, but it's only been 2 days. 
<P>
Bruce C. explains:<BR>
No, [There are no advantages to having XPs firewall in addition to a router's]. WinXP's built-in 
firewall wont provided any added protection. However:
<P>
If you use a router with NAT, it's still a very good idea to use a 3rd party software firewall.  Like WinXP's 
built-in firewall, NAT-capable routers do nothing to protect the user from him/herself (or any "curious," 
overconfident teenagers in the home).  Again -- and I cannot emphasize this enough -- almost all 
spyware and many Trojans and worms are downloaded and installed deliberately (albeit unknowingly) 
by the user.  So a software firewall, such as Sygate or ZoneAlarm, that can detect and warn the user of unauthorized outgoing traffic is an important element of protecting one's privacy and security.
<P>
(Remember: Most antivirus applications do not even scan for or protect you from adware/spyware, 
because, after all, you've installed them yourself, so you must want them there, right?)
<P>
I use both a router with NAT and Sygate Personal Firewall, even though I generally know better than to 
install scumware.  When it comes to computer security and protecting my privacy, I prefer the old "belt 
and suspenders" approach.  In the professional IT community, this is also known as a "layered defense."  Basically, it comes down to never, ever "putting all of your eggs in one basket."
<P>
WinXP's built-in firewall is adequate at stopping incoming attacks, and hiding your ports from probes.  
What WinXP SP2's firewall does not do, is protect you from any Trojans or spyware that you (or someone
else using your computer) might download and install inadvertently. It doesn't monitor outgoing traffic at 
all, other than to check for IP-spoofing, much less block (or at even ask you about) the bad or the 
questionable outgoing signals. 
<P>
It assumes that any application you have on your hard drive is there because you want it there, and 
therefore has your "permission" to access the Internet. Further, because the Windows Firewall is a 
"stateful" firewall, it will also assume that any incoming traffic that's a direct response to a Trojan's or 
spyware's outgoing signal is also authorized.
<P>
ZoneAlarm, Kerio, or Sygate are all much better than WinXP's built-in firewall, and are much more easily configured, and there are free versions of each readily available.  Even the commercially available 
Symantec's Norton Personal Firewall is superior by far, although it does take a heavier toll of system performance then do ZoneAlarm or Sygate.
<P><BR>
*** A comment and clarification. You dont want two software firewalls running eg XPs and Kerio for 
example. However, a software firewall in addition to your router's [a hardware firewall] will not present
an operational problem. As Bruce explained, the most popular non-XP firewalls also address 
OUTGOING traffic. Personally I find Kerio to be one of the leaner, minimally invasive firewalls.
<P>
I'm using version 2.1.4 and now they are up to version 4. In 4 you get more features for 30 days and after
30 days you're left with just the basics you really need anyway.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.kerio.com/kpf_download.html">http://www.kerio.com/kpf_download.html</A>
<P>
2.1.4 is still available here:
<P>
<A HREF="http://download.kerio.cz/dwn/kpf2-win.exe">http://download.kerio.cz/dwn/kpf2-win.exe</A>
<P>
Well you may be thinking, I run an updated antivirus, I take care in what I install, and I have a router so 
why should I care about a firewall that addresses outgoing traffic?  It's a good point really and I'm not
at all saying that a second firewall is a _must have_ necessity for everybody.  Yes people may disagree 
with me and that's OK.  On the other hand I could also argue that a lean software firewall cant hurt and will
add that second layer of protection. 
<P>
Also, if you do get a router it will work just fine out of the box generally with the firewall enabled by default.
And in the docs it will tell you how to access the router's firmware to configure it using its http address. If
you have a home network the router's firmware can be accessed by any pc on the network, including
your teenagers pc up in his bedroom. 
<P>
Any teen with no experience in routers can find the routers address and default password from most any
applicable game or music servers website and start opening ports. If you go for a router, I'd suggest
accessing it and setting up a new password.
