<STRONG><font color="red">1) Tool To Track Registry Changes</font></STRONG>
<P>
boe asked - [I used to use a tool] to know exactly what files were added/modified and what registry 
changes were made in case you wanted to reverse it or roll it out to your clients but I can't remember 
what it was.  Can anyone tell me of any good tools/utilities for this?

<P>
rab asked - I have a network at home, 2 Dell computers, and the printer works great, but I can't get the 
scanner to work on the network?  Is there some other way to network it?
<P>
Rick said:<BR>
In general, most scanners for the home user cannot be networked. You can only use it on the machine it 
is connected to.
<P>

You cannot share a scanner over a network in Windows XP, only printers. You can install the scanner 
software on one PC, but you cannot share the scanner itself over a network.

Bruce C. adds:<BR>
Normally, input devices cannot be shared over a network, at all, but this isn't always true of scanners.  
You'll be able to share the scanner only if it's manufacturer provided specialized software for that 
purpose.
<P>
You have to use a network-capable scanner (which immediately eliminates most, if not all, USB scanners)
and specialized software (that comes with the scanner) to do this.  If you're talking about a home 
consumer grade flatbed USB or parallel port scanner, you very probably can't.
<P>
HP, Canon, Xerox, Ocï¿½, Kyocera Mita, and other companies manufacture network capable scanners 
(They're actually multi-function devices that also copy, print, and sometimes fax and email) and the
requisite specialized software.  The cost of such devices usually starts somewhere just below $5,000.00 
USD.
<P>
The HP PrecisionScan Pro application, versions 2.03 and higher, which normally comes with some of 
HP's low-end business scanners, permits some of the scanning functions to be shared.  Consult the
documentation that came with the scanner.  (I know it works, if not very well; I've set up HP ScanJet 6300C 
and 7490C devices to be shared, using the supplied software.)

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Do I Have A Memory Leak?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Fitz wrote - I'm running WinXP Pro. I like to know how to identify to source of a memory leak. I have 1GB of 
RAM. After bootup, I'm using about 275MB of RAM for XP and running task. After using the computer for 
awhile, regardless of program, that will increase to over 450MB with everything closed and back to 
desktop. Does this sound like a memory leak, and if so, how do I identify the program/process that is 
causing it?
<P>
Ron M. said:<BR>
The basic principle with Windows and RAM is that "unused RAM is wasted RAM".
<P>
Windows will, by design, always attempt to find some use, anything whatever that might potentially be of 
some benefit, for every bit of RAM installed in the computer.   So it will increase the size of the disk cache 
to take advantage of available RAM, and will retain the program code from closed applications in RAM 
in anticipation that the application might be launched again, as is very often the case.
<P>
And Windows will instantaneously drop the more trivial of these usages should some better use come 
along for some of that RAM.
<P>
Also there are many system components and shared .DLL files that are not loaded into RAM until the first 
time they are actually needed. And because these are common items, used by more than one 
application program and/or Windows function, these items will be retained in RAM once loaded, even 
though the application that originally needed them has since been closed.
<P>
Ken B. added:<BR>
It sounds perfectly normal. Windows is designed to use all, or nearly all, your RAM all the time. If your 
apps don't need it, Windows will try to find another use for it (such as using it for cache), then give it back 
when the apps need it again.
<P>
Despite what some people apparently think, this is good, not bad. Unused RAM is wasted RAM. You 
paid for it all, and shouldn't want to see any of it unused and wasted.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Need Bios Upgrade For Old PC</font></STRONG>
<P>
Loek posted - A friend of mine owns a 1999 Fujitsu Siemens 450 Mhz computer. After having XP installed 
the system keeps rebooting.  I found out the Award-bios needs to be upgraded and the upgrade can be 
achieved by paying $ 29.95.  Unfortunately, neither my friend nor I have a credit card.  We would be very 
happy if anyone could help us out.
<P><BR>
*** Try the utils below to see if they can ID your motherboard and/or model, assuming you cant ID it on the
first screen that shows when you boot up.

<P>
One of them should be able to find your maker and model. Then go the the motherboard makers website
and look for the upgraded bios you need.
