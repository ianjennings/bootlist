<P>
RichardOz asked - I recently installed a new OS on a new hard drive. I have been trying to access files in my old documents and settings/application data folder on my previous hard drive which is connected through an enclosure. All I get is an access denied message and the properties are read only which I am unable to change.
<P>
Patti M. replied:<BR>
See if taking ownership of the files/folder helps you to access the files:

I have the same problem, the following article I think details the problem, which I think was caused by a recent update:

I contacted Microsoft and they sent me a hotfix that is not publicly available, I have installed it but I'm not sure if it has corrected the 
problem or not.
<P>
johnw adds:<BR>
You'll have to get used to it I'm afraid. It's a new behavior of IE introduced by Microsoft during the monthly patch upgrade last 
Tuesday 11 April to sidestep a court decision -- they're in a patent battle with a startup called Eolas -- which did not go their way.
<P>
More info here:<BR>

<P>
Some background to the change can be found here:<BR>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eolas">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eolas</A>
<P>
Eolas has only targeted Microsoft (and IE) in defence of their patent to date. Firefox and other browsers have escaped the wrath of Eolas for the time being so you wont see any changes in those browsers.

Paul.Tao.C. asked - When in IE 6 on a XP box,  http:\\ wont be added after you type say www.cnn.com. so I get a cant display page  message.  However, my auto address complete is checked, so when I type cnn and ctrl+enter, it works as it should.  This just 
happened a couple days ago.  Any ideas?

For those who have Hewlett Packard's Share to Web Software, there are two registry patches to choose from (run either one or the 
other) not both:

I've made a "patch" back on Saturday available at:

(Note this is a Zip file and will need to be extracted. It contains a REG file which needs to be imported into the registry via double 
clicking the contained REG file. You may have to reboot Windows afterwards.)
<P>

Kelly has made a patch with exact same functionality available at:

Line #383 - this is a vbs file and instructions on how to use such files are at the top of the page.
<P>
Both of the above mentioned "patches" for the KB908531 *do not* work for Windows 2000. See the MSKB article 918165 for details.

rajkohli replied:<BR>
See the following article. It describes the reasons that why it is missing:

<P>
Ramesh added:<BR>
This problem may occur if there is no drive C on your computer. MSConfig utility looks for a boot.ini file in C:\ root.
<P>
To manually edit the boot.ini file, see:
