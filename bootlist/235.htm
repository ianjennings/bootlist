<P>
Alex C. asked - I was restarting the PC after hibernate recently and I got a Blue Screen.  I rebooted.  
Where can I find any log info about this crash?
<P>
Doug K. answered:<BR>
The file will be in C:\Windows\Minidump
<P>
Daniel M. added:<BR>
Simply open Start, Run, type (without quotes) '%SystemRoot%\Minidump' and click OK. The minidump 
files will appear on the screen.

davej678 wrote - I need to reinstall my windows xp operating system and start from scratch. The problem 
is, I dont have the xp disc because it (windows xp) was already pre-installed on the system when I 
purchased it. what can I do?   My computer manufacturer was no help.  I could not get a hold of a real 
person to talk to.
<P>
Ken B. answered:<BR>
OEM vendors are required by their agreement with Microsoft to give you a means of reinstalling, should it 
be necessary. They can do this in one of three ways:
<P>
1. An OEM copy of Windows
<P>
2. A restore CD
<P>
3. A hidden partition on your drive, with restore information.
<P>
If you don't have 1 or 2, you should have 3, but you should contact your vendor or check your system documentation  to find out.
<P>
Personally, I find both 2 and 3 unacceptable, and would never choose to buy a computer that came with 
an operating system unless I got a complete generic installation CD for that operating system.
<P><BR>
*** If your OEM PC maker provided you with Item 3 above and your hard drive crashes, then you may 
have to buy XP again to acquire a CD to get your system back up.  However, since you did pay for XP 
when you bought your system, even tho it you didn't get the disk, I'd certainly first request that the vender 
supply the ways and means to install XP again on your new drive.

<P>
Bill asked - I sometimes get a caption in the tray that one of my usb devices is not working.  I don't want to 
be reminded of this.  How do I stop this alert from coming up ?
<P>
Daniel M. responded:<BR>
1. Open Start, Run, type (without quotes) 'devmgmt.msc' and click OK.<BR>
2. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers. <BR>
3. Double-click your USB controller.<BR>
4. Select the Advanced tab.<BR>
5. Check the box 'Don't tell me about USB errors'.
<P><BR>
*** You may see what looks like a _parent_ controller and several, 2-4,  sons/daughters. Do the parent 
first. If no joy then also do the sons/daughters.  One can always change it back if you dont like the results.

<P>
Mr. Grodersteinman asked - I've been using Norton System Works 2004 but something messed up and I 
have to remove it first before I put it on again but it wont uninstall.  Do I have to go into my Registry like the guy at the computer store said and find all the entries and remove them? 
<P><BR>
*** Symantec has a special tool for your problem. It's a utility that you should use if you cant remove
many Nortons applications the regular way. The file is called symnrt.exe and is available here:
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/linked_files/tsgen/SymNRT.exe">ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/linked_files/tsgen/SymNRT.exe</A>
<BR>
Note I really would have liked to add a link to a standard URL at symantecs page describing the file but 
the only one I get is one of those page addresses that's about 5 miles long and created on the fly so I 
dont know if the link will work beyond a few days.
<P>
Here is the description page anyway using a URL shortener. Perhaps the link will survive a few days:<BR>
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/dmac3">http://tinyurl.com/dmac3</A>
<P>
If not, one can do a search at their site entering in symnrt.exe and eventually you will find the description if 
you need it. When you run symnrt.exe it will first show you what it handles in any case. 
<P>
While you are at it keep in mind there are a bunch of other Nortons removal tools at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/helpdesk.htm">http://www.bootdisk.com/helpdesk.htm</A>
<P>
That you many want to download and keep in your repair kit.
