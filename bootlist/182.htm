<STRONG><font color="red">1) Saving Old Floppy Disk Data</font></STRONG>
<P>
PeterM asks - One of the ladies in the office asked me if there is a way I can recover what is lost on one 
of the company floppy disks. The error message reads the disk is not formatted. Back in the old days I 
use to use PC Tools. Is there something like that out there for me to buy?
<P><BR>
*** While that seems like an XP message I'm not going into how to get XP to read old floppies in this
article. If you have trouble reading data on an old floppy there are a few things to try:
<P>
Boot to dos on a win9x pc and try to copy the contents of the disk to a directory on the hard drive. First 
make sure its a pc where the floppy drive is regularly used because if the drive hasn't been used in
ages it can only take a second for your valuable disk to act like a cleaner and grab all the dust and 
grime off the unused drive. Note that if this happens and you put the disk in a known good drive it can
mess that one up as well by transferring the dust and grime to the heads on the good drive. 
<P>
You may get lucky and it will copy the file you need but may give you an error for the next file, and so on, 
or the copy process may continue after the bad file and copy the rest of the disk. If you are unsure how 
long since the floppy drive has been used use compressed air then a disk cleaner ie the type that 
comes with fluid that you put on a cleaner disk to clean the drive first. Then use a disposable disk to test
the drive out first before you put in the disk you really want the data back from.  You may have to use a
few tossable disks as even after a cleaning some smudge may remain on the heads and your test
disks will act as secondary cleaners. 
<P>
In summary, the first step is to make sure your drive is OK and clean before you try anything else as you
dont want to cause further damage to the disk that has the data you need to recover.

Jon C. adds:<BR>
Try PC Inspector. It's free and does a pretty good job.

<P>
Yes pc inspector was mentioned just last month for hard drive file recovery but it's reposted here as it
also supports fat12 ie 1.44 disks.

Chloe wrote - I just noticed a file called WIN386.SWP in my windows folder which is over 200 Meg in size.  
Anyone know if this is deletable to free up some disk space?  What is its purpose? [I am using Windows
98 Second Edition]
<P><BR>
*** That's your windows virtual memory file. It's used when you dont have enough physical ram to run 
your apps and/or windows so windows creates a virtual ram file called win386.swp on your hard drive. 
If you do have enough ram for what you do the swap file will be around 35 meg in windows 98SE. 
<P>
You are a prime candidate to add more physical ram which will REALLY speed up your system, 
especially if you have a 5,400 or 4,800 RPM hard drive.  Note that even if you had a good amount of ram
windows will still create a small swap file which is normal. 
<P>
In other words, if your swap file is over 50 or 75 megs during normal computer use then you can 
speed up your system by adding more physical ram.  Note that this advice does NOT apply to XP
pagefiles/swapfile as it's created differently. 
<P>
eg Windows XP will create a rather large pagefile on bootup but may only use a small portion of it.  
Windows 9x creates what it needs on demand.
