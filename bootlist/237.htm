<STRONG><font color="red">1) How To Turn Off Caps Lock</font></STRONG>
<P>
Peter A. asked - I rarely use the Caps Lock and Numlock keys but do press them accidentally all too 
often. I am looking for a utility to prevent this - ideally it would make it difficult to activate accidentally, 
perhaps by requiring the key be held down for half a sec before registering. Are there any such? 
<P>
Ken B. replied:<BR>
You can turn off the keys entirely with SharpKeys at:<BR>

<P>
I always turn off Caps Lock and Insert, two keys I never want to use, but often press accidentally.

OK, there are lots of Temporary File and Internet Cache cleaners, but, perhaps you'll like the way this one 
as it has many different types of options to do it automatically and has a good menu of file types to select.

old. I can enable/disable it but I can't seem to remove it.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) USB Drive Letter Problem</font></STRONG>
<P>
Rich inquired - Like others I have a number of usb devices. When I plug a media card or memory stick 
into the usb [port] nothing opens even though all the drivers are loaded for these devices. I get the audio 
that a device has been plugged in but cannot find it.
<P>
I have to reboot with the device plugged in and I will find it under My Computer in Network Drives as
a disconnected network drive.  Once I double click it will open and show the contents of the card or stick.
[Is there a fix?]
<P>
CW answers:<BR>
I believe this is the usual cause.

This problem occurs if you map a network drive to the first available drive letter following the drive letters 
for the local volumes and CD/DVD drives.  When you install a new device or volume, a software called 
Mount Manager tries to assign drive letters to the new volumes. But since the software does not 
recognize mapped drive letters, it assigns the next available local drive letter to the new device. This 
causes a collision with the existing mapped network drive.
<P>

<P><BR>
*** In other words, if you want to map a network drive(s) then choose a drive letter(s) way down the 
alphabet.  I usually assign mapped drive letters X, Y, and Z.  Makes it easier to use in an office or
small business setup as well.
<P>
On a related issue, this reminds me of why I always strongly suggest that you assign out of the way
drive letters for your CDrom drives. For example, I always setup pcs so the cd reader is drive R: and the
CD writer, if one has 2 drives, is drive W:. This puts them out of the way so when you add second hard 
drive or hard drive partitions [resulting in new drive letters] then it wont conflict with the drive letter of your CDrom drive. 
<P>
By conflict, yes I know that if you add a new HDD the CDrom drives will simply be assigned the next 
letters(s) inline. But, that change may affect some software that you have installed that is used to looking
for a certain CDrom letter eg software that requires that you have the CD in to play a game. 
<P>
In summary, setup your pc to permanently assign drive letters for CDrom drives or Mapped drives in the 
latter part of the alphabet. This way when you add new USB or other temporary devices that need a drive letter you minimize the chance of running into conflicts or niggles.

Joe B. emailed:
<P>
Looked through your site for some USB boot related material and think you might want to take a look at 
the work of John T. Haller.
<P>
He's put together an assemblage of portable apps enabling the user to effectively work from the USB 
drive on any host system.  They total out at about 150mb and include:  Firefox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice 
Suite, Sunbird schedule coordinator and the HTML editor 'NVU'. 
<P>
I've been playing around with this stuff for a few days and it works. Here's the link:
