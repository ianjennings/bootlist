<STRONG><font color="red">1) Hide Your Webpage Email Address From Spammers</font></STRONG>
<P>
Gerry  P. emailed - The reason I'm writing is to suggest a different (perhaps more secure) way to hide your 
e-mail address [on your webpages] from spammers. My script [also] allows additional elements like 
default Subject, CC, Bcc, 
Body, etc.
<P><BR>
*** Hi Gerry, I'm already using a script which works:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.javascript-page.com/emailprotect.html">http://www.javascript-page.com/emailprotect.html</A>
<P>
Gerry mails back: I know it works. I've used it :) What my script offers that's new and (imho) better is:
<P>
1) the string "mailto:" is not there<BR>
2) the "@" sign is not there<BR>
3) a "tail" for default subject, body, cc, etc.
<P>
In my opinion, it's an improvement not to have "mailto" in the source text, because if I were designing a 
filter or tool to harvest addresses, I would have it search for "mailto:" and "@", which would get a hit on 
your pages, but not on my pages.
<P><BR>
*** I put together a few pages to make all this easier to view, copy, paste, and setup. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/txtfiles/email.txt">http://www.bootdisk.com/txtfiles/email.txt</A>
<P>
I like the fact that you can use Gerry's script to put in a Subject which one can then use to filter mail that 
doesn't contain the subject if one so desires.   
<P>
If you're wondering, "why bother" with all this? Well, email addresses on webpages using standard html 
tags created by your html editor are harvested by "spiders" and are accumulated into spam lists. The
two best ways to combat that and minimize spam due to webpage email harvesters are to either create 
a small .gif with your email address as the graphic or use one of the scripts discussed above.

Gene notes - I have Windows XP with SP1 and SP2.  Two days ago, my USB 2.0 stopped working at high speed.  I have tried reinstalling the drivers, but the reinstalled drivers are not high speed. [Any hints on
how to make it all OK again?]

Carey F. answers:<BR>
The Windows XP CD is bootable and contains all the tools necessary to partition and format your drive.  
Follow this procedure and allow Windows XP to partition and format your drive:
<P>
NOTE:  It would be best to physically disconnect all your peripheral hardware devices, except the 
monitor, mouse and keyboard, before installing XP.
<P>
NOTE:  If you have an internal Zip Drive installed, physically disconnect the EIDE and power cable to it 
before proceeding, otherwise your main hard drive may not be assigned the customary C: drive letter.  
After installing Windows XP, you may then reconnect it.
<P>
1.  Open your BIOS and set your "CD Drive as the first bootable device".

<A HREF="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/bios_manufacturer.htm">http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/bios_manufacturer.htm</A>
<P>
2.  Insert your Windows XP CD in the CD Drive and reboot your computer.
<P>
3.  You'll see a message to boot to the CD.  Follow the instructions.
<P>
4.  The setup menu will appear and you should elect to delete all the existing Windows partitions, then 
create a new partition, then format the primary partition (preferably NTFS) and proceed to install Windows
XP.
<P>
5. Clean Install Windows XP:<BR>
<A HREF="http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html">http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html</A>
<P>
6. Immediately after installing Windows XP, turn on XP's Firewall:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/protect/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/protect/default.mspx</A>
<P>
7. After Windows XP is installed, visit the Windows Update website and download the available "Critical Updates".  [Or install SP2]
<P>
8. After installing the critical updates, be sure and visit the support website of the manufacturer of the 
computer to download and install any available Windows XP compatible drivers, such as video 
adapter and audio drivers.
<P>
9. If you happen to run into any installation difficulties, use the following resource:

*** Yes there are other methods to install XP fresh, but Carey put some time into this list and it's fine, and 
may even have a few tips you weren't aware of before.

<P>
Alias asked - I bought a 17" Philips TFT monitor and it looks great except for some fonts. The 
background looks great, most fonts on web pages look great. Times New Roman's "ys" and "wws" 
aren't as bold as the other letters and Courier looks very faded and like it's missing pixels, for example.
<P>
Any suggestions? I have the correct up to date video drivers and monitor drivers installed, Running XP 
Pro SP2.
<P>
Jim M. suggests trying:<BR>
Try the Windows XP Power Toys ClearType Tuner (New). This PowerToy lets you use ClearType 
technology to make it easier to read text on your screen, and installs in the Control Panel for easy access.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Using W2K Drivers For HP Printer On XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mr. Gabay asked - I have XP and a older HP printer. XP installed its driver for the printer but I'm missing 
all the bells and whisles that came with the printer on my Windows 98 PC.  On the HP website there is no 
XP driver for download but there is a Windows 2000 driver. Can I use that to get all the special features I 
want like head allignment and large page printing?   
<P><BR>
*** Well, in all honesty that is a legitimate thing to try, and many techs would take a shot at it and even
recommend that you try it yourself. After all, Windows 2000 is just NT5 and XP is just NT5.1 so it "may" 
work. 
<P>
But, it's a risk and you better do all the standard precautions first, like making sure you have a good 
restore point, a separate copy of the good, working registry, closing down or disabling all background
apps first, removing the old driver, then following the printer install docs EXACTLY.

Anando answered:<BR>
This can be easily accomplished with the help of  TweakUI powertoy for Windows XP. Under TweakUI,
navigate to 'common dialog | places bar' and you can specify your custom places here.

In addition to what Anando said you can only have five entries there, so you'll need to replace one of 
them.
