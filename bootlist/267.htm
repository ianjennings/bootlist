<P>
dsteel0 asked - I'm looking to create a slipstreamed Windows XP Installation CD that will install Windows XP, SP2 and all the latest Updates. I know getting an XP SP2 CD is easy enough but what about the updates? I've heard conflicting stories of whether or not this can be done, and a couple of hour's Google work doesn't make it any clearer. Even if tehre is *not* a way to do this, is there a reliable way of creating an unattended install, which will then (unattended) go and install all of the latest updates from the 'Net?
<P>
ByTor suggests:<BR>
nLite. Easiest, way less complicated method:

<P>
Go here & grab all the individual updates. Yes you have to download each one & it may be a little inconvenient but *WELL* worth it in 
the end.

This all providing, I'm assuming, you have a full retail CD? I honestly have never touched OEM's, proprietary restore CD's & stuff like 
that so maybe someone else can validate if nLite works on those. 
<P>
Ron M. added:<BR>
nLite works just fine with generic OEM installation CDs - the ones with only the Microsoft name and logo on them.  
<P>
R. McC. buds in:<BR>
I've Slipstreamed OEM (specifically Dell) XP disks/i386 folders & it will work if you use the /Integrate qualifier on the command line
when incorporating the Service Pack/Hotfix.

spike inquired - When hovering the mouse pointer over an Excel file on my local drive, the popup description shows the basic info 
plus other file properties that I've saved in the file, such as Author, Title, Subject, Comments. However, when I move this same file to 
one of the servers, only the Type, Size and Date show in the popup description.  How can I get the properties like subject, title, comments to show up in the popup description when looking at a file on a network folder from my workstation?

Jajomoal posted - The file is located in C:/windows. The file name is msnavpklog.txt and it so large it will not open. It is constantly 
being used or modified by a program it will not let me delete it. What should I do with it.

EdW. asked - I have the same sub-directory on two different hard drives. The sub-directory on each hard drive has several sub-directories also. Each of these sub-directory contains hundreds of text files. I want to combine all of the files into one sub-directory on one hard drive.
<P>
My problem is, I have made changes to the text files on both drives, but not with any consistency, so drive c: has some updated files, 
and drive d: has some updated files (but not necessarily the same updated files).
<P>
How can I do a compare of the files on each of these text files on the two different directories, and either overwrite the older files, or flag them to be looked at to then overwrite them?

WinMerge is the ultimate multiple directory tree comparison software, and it's FREE!  For those of us who recall the srccom days of 
Unix antiquity, this is an F-15 compared to the Wright Flyer.

JS suggested:<BR>
Try Beyond Compare. They give you a 30 day eval.:<BR>
