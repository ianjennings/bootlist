<STRONG><font color="red">1) Scanning Email Is Redundant</font></STRONG>
<P>
Hannis asks - Is it necessary for my Norton Anti Virus 2005 to be configured with scanning incoming and 
outgoing emails from my Outlook Express?
<P><BR>
*** No. It's redundant. No need to employ that feature.
<P>
Peter F. said:<BR>
Email scanning can create multiple problems in Outlook Express. These include duplicate emails, 
missing emails, identity corruption, breaking of links, outgoing mail not being received, etc,etc,etc,. No 
need to use email scanning. Your resident Norton Anti Virus will still protect you.
<P>
Ron B. adds:<BR>
I would turn *off* the email scanning both in and out.  If you check Norton's site, they even admit that 
scanning [email] is not necessary.

"Disabling Email Scanning does not leave you unprotected against viruses that are distributed as email
attachments." 
<P>
Ken B. says:<BR>
[Scanning email is] not necessary, and [many] people have reported problems in doing so.  [Your 24/7
anti-virus will pick up any problems with the email scan feature turned off].

Regarding the bootlist question on scanner sharing;  These guys make device servers that allow one to 
plug in a scanner (or other usb device) and share it on  the network. WiFi and wired versions available.  
They're fairly inexpensive, and pretty cool.

Jack B. wrote - Can anyone recommend a good alternative to Windows Explorer? I have been using 
Power Desk for years with WinMe but it seems to be acting up since I switched to XP.
<P>
Thorsten M. answered:<BR>
I use the Total Commander here, which works the same like the good old Norton Commander.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) How To Force Applications To Open Full Size</font></STRONG>
<P>
Cameron inquired - This may seem a bit strange, but when a new window opens it is not full size. I click on 
the "box" to make it full size and after closing the window the next window to open is still small.
<P>
Mike said:<BR>
In Windows, most window sizes will be remembered as the last size they were closed at, so resize using 
the grab bar in the bottom right corner -- do NOT maximize -- and then hold the CTRL button and close 
the window.  Note: it is more likely to succeed if you only have one instance of the particular application 
open at the time you resize.
<P>
nonews adds:<BR>
[Try] AutoSizer. It is free and is the best solution so far:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.southbaypc.com/AutoSizer/">http://www.southbaypc.com/AutoSizer/</A>
<P><BR>
*** AutoSizer is pretty harmless but try it the old fashioned way before you depend on a utility.  Of course
sometimes a particular niggle cant be worked out so you use the utility until the next time you install fresh.
Sort of like putting a plug in a flat tire :)

<STRONG><font color="red">5) CD And DVD Drives Stopped Working In XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
arniesarmy posted - All of a sudden [my CD and DVD drives do not work. Any tips?].
<P><BR>
*** First check your bios to make sure the secondary channel is "turned on" assuming you have both
drives there as a surge may have changed it to Disabled. Then check for a boot sector virus especially if 
your XP is on a FAT32 partition. To check for a boot sector virus on a FAT32 partition you'll need a clean bootdisk and an anti-virus app that works after a dos boot. 
<P>
And if both drives are on the same cable make sure it hasn't come loose. Often it's hard to fit the primary
and secondary cable to the motherboard if both connectors have the data cable running against each 
other and the secondary may have just popped out of the socket a bit. Same thing with the power cables.
If one is loose both drives may become disabled. 
<P>
Or, if one drive went south than a dead drive on the same channel can/may keep the other drive from
working or even being seen by the bios on post.  No matter what OS you have, one can always use a 
dos bootdisk with cdrom drivers to first check if its an XP or hardware problem. 
<P>
In other words, it doesn't matter what OS you run. If you use a dos bootdisk with cdrom drivers and they
load up and drive letters are assigned, and you can read disks, then you know its an OS problem, not
a hardware problem.

*** If you're running win9X and not XP, a boot sector virus OR a noide key in the registry are the two most
common reasons cdrom drives drives stop working.  You'll see them "yellow flagged" in Device manager. 
To search the registry in win9x for a noide key simply run regedit | Edit | Find and type:
<P>
noide
<P>
and search. Delete any noide keys found. Use F3 to find Next [aka more entries], if any.
