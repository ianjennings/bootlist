<STRONG><font color="red">1) A Good Way To Back Up The Registry</font></STRONG>
<P>
The Babaloughesian asked - I have XP Home.  And the virus backdoor.nibu.e.  In order to remove this
virus, I must remove some registry entries.  It has been recommended that before doing this, I backup the registry just in case. [What is a good way to back up the registry?]
<P>
Jim B suggests:<BR>Hi Baba - Get Erunt here for all NT-based computers including XP:
<P>

<P>
I've set it up to take a scheduled backup each night at 12:01AM on a weekly round-robin basis, and a
Monthly on the 1st of each month.  See here for how to set that up:

<P>
And for some useful information about this subject.
<P>
This program is one of the best things around - saved my butt on many occasions, and will also run very 
nicely from a DOS prompt (in case you've done something that wont let you boot any more and need to 
revert to a previous Registry).
<P>
If you're FAT32 OR have a DOS startup disk with NTFS write drivers in an NTFS system.  (There is also a 
way using the Recovery Console to get back to being "bootable" even without separate DOS write NTFS drivers, after which you can do a normal ERDNT restore.  If you make your backup into a folder inside 
your Windows or Winnt folder, you can restore at a Recovery Console boot by copying the files from that ERDNT folder into the system32\config one.  After a good boot, then do another normal ERDNT restore 
to also restore the user hives.)  (BTW, it also includes a Registry defragger program).  Free, and very, 
very highly recommended.
<P>
FYI, quoting from the above document:
<P>
Note: The "Export registry" function in Regedit is USELESS (!) to make a complete backup of the registry. Neither does it export the whole registry (for example, no information from the "SECURITY" hive is saved), 
nor can the exported file be used later to replace the current registry with the old one. Instead, if you 
re-import the file, it is merged with the current registry, leaving you with an absolute mess of old and new registry keys.

*** Just a note that there are many other reasons for CDs burned on one system to NOT be viewed
correctly on another system ranging from quality of the media to even brands and the age of the drive. 
Without going into the many details regarding such, if you are making data backups, make sure you
always test the backup in at least the other pcs in your home or office to make sure you REALLY have
a usable backup. Simply creating the data backup cd does not mean your done.

Outlook?  What good is this if my attachments wont open?
<P><BR>
*** It has probably already saved you from installing a trojan. 
<P>
How to handle attachments:
<P>
1. Are you expecting an attachment?<BR>
2. Make sure your backup anti-virus scanner is up to date<BR>
3. Save the file to a folder on your hard drive<BR>
4. Make sure the file looks legit, ie a filename.zip.scr is NOT legit<BR>
5. Use your backup anti-virus program to just scan that file or folder<BR>
6. If the file is packed, ie a .zip or other, unpack it to that same folder<BR>
7. Scan again using your backup scanner<BR>
8. Now use the proper application to open up the file, ie Word, etc.
<P>
As I've noted in several previous articles, you really should have 2 anti-virus programs on your computer. Keep one working 24/7 if you want, but also keep a second one updated and ready to go as a double check. 
<P>
Mark S adds:<BR>
Generally do not open mails with attachments .pif .vbs .com .exe or .bat
<P><BR>
*** While Marks comment is well intentioned, I send .exes, .coms, and .bats to people. The difference is 
they are expecting the file. Again, the rule is to NOT open attachments you are not expecting. And, even 
if you are expecting it, I'd still do the save first then do a manual scan. I also have my email program set 
to read mail in text mode only. 
<P>
Sounds like a lot of work? Perhaps, but I never get infected. I also do the same manual scan after
downloading a file via my web browser.  ie save, scan, unpack, then scan again.

Ken posted - I just bought a refurbished Laptop which had been registered in the previous owner's name. 
I can re-install windows to get the computer in my name, but will I be able to re-register XP, and if so, how?

<P><BR>
*** As an aside, when buying a used laptop, make sure you get the recovery disks with it or dont bother, 
as they will most often contain the proprietary drivers you need to get it working again with minimal 
hassle. Without the disks, you may really be out of luck when you have to reload the OS, no matter if its
Windows 98 or XP. Laptops are married to their recovery/install CDs.
