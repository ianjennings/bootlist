<STRONG><font color="red">2) CD Burner Not Listed Anymore In Windows 98</font></STRONG>
<P>
Hurricane1000 asks - Somehow my cd burner isn't listed anymore. I went to My Computer and the drive 
doesn't show, but when I start my computer, it's showed.  I've had it for a few years and I don't have any 
software. How can I get it back? [I'm using windows 98 Second Edition]
<P>
Lloyd Jones suggests:<BR>
The laser might have burned out like my bugger did, I only had the thing 2 months!
<P><BR>
*** Well, his drive _may_ be bad however since it shows up at post it should still show up in windows even
if it is bad. One can try booting with a bootdisk that has cdrom drivers on it to check whether its a drive or windows problem. 
<P>
Thor says:<BR>
Check your hard disk controllers in the device manager. Chances are that one or more is flagged with a problem.
<P><BR>
*** I agree. A boot sector virus may cause that as well as a noide key in the registry. One can search for
a noide key using regedit and delete the key(s) if found. It wont do any harm. It can only do good. 
<P>
Sometimes, to  [protect itself] Windows may put a noide key in the registry.  Start | Run | regedit | click OK 
and then Edit | Find | noide | Then click Find Next and wait.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Volume XP Licensing And sysprep</font></STRONG>
<P>
beardofdeath posts - Has anyone seen this problem? What did you do to resolve it?
<P>
Background: The firm purchased 60 new Gateway computers, all completely identical. Because many preinstalled programs needed to be removed plus numerous programs we use needed to be installed I 
created a base image. I then clone a hard drive, run sysprep on it, activate windows, create user 
accounts, etc. and finish customizing the computer for the user. 
<P>
This has generally worked great. However, now had two systems (after 30 to 45 days use) that boot up 
and say windows has to be activated. Course it wont let you do anything until that's completed. So I 
activate and it tells me activated too many times. Have to make phone call and do the procedure.
<P>
Problem is, after reactivating it drops me to a blank desktop with no taskbar, no nothing! Twice now. The 
first instance I just rebuilt everything from scratch, no cloning, etc. Now a second machine. Don't want to 
rebuild.
<P>
What's going on here? What can I do to prevent this situation in the future?
<P>
Carey F. suggests:<BR>
The problem you have is you must use the individual OEM Product Key assigned to each computer.  
Sounds like you are attempting to use just one Product Key for each installation which is contrary to OEM licensing.  This is one reason why Volume Licensing (VL) is recommended when using sysprep.
<P>
Whoever ordered your Gateway PCs should have requested Volume Licensing instead of OEM 
licensing, but I sense someone did not do a little research into this area.

beardofdeath replies - You are correct. I don't believe my boss ever considered this kind of issue until 
well after the fact.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Got A New Dell. Need Real MS Help & Support</font></STRONG>
<P>
Roberto inquires - I have a DELL pc and they insist on having their own version of the Help & Support 
Centre. Is there a way to set this back to the Microsoft standard one please?
<P>
Kelly delineates:<BR>
Follow this advice, posted earlier.
<P>
On a Dell system it will look like this:  Start/Run/Regedit
<P>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2559a1f6-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}\Instance\InitPropertyBag]
<P>
"CLSID"="{13709620-C279-11CE-A49E-444553540000}"<BR>
"method"="ShellExecute"<BR>
"Command"="Dell Solution Center"<BR>
"Param1"="c:\\Program Files\\Dell\\SolutionCenter\\DellSC.exe"
<P>
To return to XP Default, delete the Param1 line and modify the rest to match:
<P>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2559a1f1-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}\Instance\InitPropertyBag]
<P>
"CLSID"="{13709620-C279-11CE-A49E-444553540000}"<BR>
"method"="Help"<BR>
"command"="@shell32.dll,-12709"
<P>
Once done hit refresh, then Help and Support.
<P><BR>
*** I wonder why Dell keeps on insisting on installing proprietary apps that results in techs moving away
from their products due to the problems and extra work they cause.
