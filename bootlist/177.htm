<STRONG><font color="red">3) How To Connect A Printer To A Router</font></STRONG>
<P>
Richard O. questions - Currently I have a cable modem hooked to a linksys router with 3 good ports.  Two 
of the ports are connected to computers.  Both computers are using win 98 2nd edition.  An HP 840C 
printer is connected locally to one computer and remotely, via networking, to the other computer.
<P>
To print from the remote computer I have to have both computers up and running. Is there a way to 
connect the printer to the Linksys router so that I don't have to turn on both computers to print from the 
remote computer?

They have both USB and Parallel interface print server modules that will allow you to connect your printer directly to the network.

John comments regarding  [4.3 Gigs Of Temp Files] from issue 175
<P>
A much simpler solution is to:
<P>
1. Just restart the PC.<BR>
2. Then open Windows Explorer, navigate to the temp folder, then click on the Date column, sort 
everything descending by date.  The delete everything older than today (select the first one you want to 
delete, then shift select the last to select everything in between, then shift/delete to permanently delete 
them all.

Aristiana comments regarding  [What's My IP Address?] from Issue 174
<P>
In Windows XP, if using the PPPoE connection, you can get the IP address somewhere else, which is 
also a lot easier.
<P>
Just either double-click on the two little screens on the tray and click on the Support tab, or go to Start -> 
Control Panel -> Network connections -> double-click on the DSL connection.
<P>
Same thing can apply if the DSL uses DHCP. Though the screens may not be in the tray, but the good 
thing is that on the Support tab there's a Repair button which does exactly the same as ipconfig /renew.
<P>
Some images that shows what I' talking about. It's only DHCP, but the look is the same for PPPoE:<BR>

<P>
Though they circled the Properties button for unknown reason. It's really the Support tab. All of this is not available in Windows 2k.

<P>
A customer just showed me this. Right mouse click in a blank space on the IE Toolbar, usually on the 
right side and deselect any toolbars displayed there. Often many of the third party add-ons are there. 
This wont work on all added toolbars but it will work with many of them.
