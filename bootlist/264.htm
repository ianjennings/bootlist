NOTE: Every 6 months or so I take the time to recommend to my readers the webhosting company I've been using for years. They 
dont have the "slick" webpage layout you often see with other hosters, but they provide the personal and professional service that I require which is what really counts. 
<P>
Most domains will only need their $5.00/month plan. In any case your site is hosted at a Data Center in Houston, Texas USA. 
1gighost is NOT a reseller of hosting plans, but is a true webhosting firm.   
<P>
Need more information? Call [the owner] personally at 260-312-2320. His name is Randy and he will do the best to accommodate 
your needs.The company is <A HREF="http://www.1gighost.com/">http://www.1gighost.com/</A>

Posting from another user by the name of David:
<P>
"I figured out what the problem is.  It's the Microsoft Wireless Mouse.  If I switch the mouse to one with a tail the screensaver works. I 
got a fix.  I changed the connection to the computer using the USB to PS2 adapter that came with the mouse.  Now I get the screensaver."
<P>
Another checkpoint - make sure that a program is not causing the computer to remain active. You may have a program running in the background that springs into life when the computer is idle.
<P><BR>
*** The above address standard Windows screen savers. Third party screen savers present their own set of potential niggles. Also
keep in mind that many folks design screen savers and only test them on their home pc before publishing them for download.
These third party screen savers may also appear on popular download sites and may NOT ever been tested before they post
them.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Utility For Photoshop Users</font></STRONG>
<P>
My son, the artist that he is, put this resource pack together. It's a huge hit for Photoshop users. 
<P>
Verbiage from download.com:
<P>
"22Pixels Flock is a breakthrough in digital resources. Flock is one file, containing over 300 files inside. Flock contains 153 Fonts that 
self install, 158 brush packs for Photoshop 7 and up, self-install, and over 50 additional packs for Photoshop 7 and up. Each pack, contains about 30-40 presets, all in one file, self install. We would estimate that Flock contains over 7000 individual presets, in 
addition to the 150 fonts. All in one file, one download, one install. This is the one file that every digital, graphic, and Web designer needs."

"Photoshop 7 and up" means Photoshop 7 and the new names, Photoshop CS and Photoshop CS2.  Also note that Flock will not
slow down XP at all, but "may", in some cases, slow down the initial launching of Photoshop. It's a 90 Meg download that includes
a nice install facility.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Bandwidth And Traffic</font></STRONG>
<P>
This is a confusing subject to many people so perhaps I can try to explain it the best way I know how. 
<P>
Bandwidth is, by classic definition, the maximum amount a wire/cable can transmit data in a certain time period. 
<P>
For example, back in 1992, a T1 line was advertised as delivering 1.5 Mbps of bandwidth.  At that time T1s were the "backbone" of
the Internet.  These days, 40+ Mbps pipes/cables are considered backbone.  As one can see from the next article in this letter it's
now common for home users to have 1.5 Mbps service at home. How times have changed. 
<P>
Traffic, [aka transfer] on the other hand, is the amount of data that yourdomain.com is/can be, transmitted through a "pipe" for a 
certain time period. In other words, bandwidth is the size of a highway, say 10 lanes. Traffic is the amount of cars traveling on the highway.  
<P>
Yes even on stats pages that keep track of the data your site serves will often say bandwidth instead of traffic [aka transfer]. Perhaps 
they really mean "bandwidth used" per total bandwidth available :) 
<P>
When shopping for a webhost for your domain, make sure that you know in advance how much "traffic" you are "really" paying for. 
This is often noted in gigs/month. Note that many webhosters use the term "bandwidth" when they actually mean "traffic". And also 
note that some webhosts say you have XXX Terarabytes of access but they "may" really mean the size of the "pipe" they have, eg it 
may not be the amount of traffic you are allowed.  Traffic is the amount of data that will be served to your visitors, including file downloads, for a certain time period, usually per month. 
<P>
The new "Sales Hook".  Some webhosters are now "offering" 1, or 1.5 TB Bandwidth/Transfer for $8/month. This is NOT possible. 
They are counting on that 99% of their new customers will never need such traffic allowance.  Also kindly note that the wholesale 
price for 1 TB/month of traffic is about $100/month to the reseller so it's simply not possible to offer that amount of traffic allowance for 
$8/month.  If you go with such a plan with false advertising and require loads of traffic chances are your site will go down without 
notice. Not good if your site is for business and you've paid for any service in advance. 
<P>
Randy O. added:
<P>
Traffic will be the total amount of data BOTH IN AND OUT OF YOUR SITE. (Inbound is included in this number) This includes the 
email accounts you setup for user@yourdomain.com 
<P>
The (sales hook). Some web hosts are now "offering" 1, or 1.5TB Bandwidth/Transfer for $8/month. This is NOT feasible for a 
number of reasons.
<P>
Physical capacity: Most shared servers are on 10Mps connections. This means in 30 days, the server could send out a maximum of 3200Gbyts of data (3.2 Terabytes) per month. So we, [ie webhosters, would be] limited to three $8 per month accounts [assuming
the sales hook was true]. 
<P>
Worse yet, server slowdowns will occur at about 50% of this 3.2Tb per month, so as long as you are the ONLY account on the server, this is a great plan!  Costs: Wholesale costs on 1 Terabyte data transfer averages around $100. So I get $100 worth of traffic for $8, another great deal!  Reality: 99.99% of all websites use  [less than] 10Gigabytes per month of traffic. If you try to use this 1.2Tb, you would be removed for using to much memory, CPU or hard drive time by % of use. (Read your AUP/TOS you will see if you exceed 
X% of resources, they can remove your account without notice)
<P><BR>
*** A side note regarding email traffic. Several times now I've had clients who run small companies with 10 or less employees call me and say their website and email doesn't work anymore. Turned out the boss set very large allowances for the email accounts and the
workers were using them to receive large videos and movies which took him over his monthly traffic allowance.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Bits And Bytes</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mfarcus telephoned - I just had DSL installed and they promised "Download at up to 1.5Mbps", but sometimes, it seems the service 
is only about twice as fast as my 56K modem.  What's the deal? My DSL company says they are delivering the service I am paying 
for. 
<P><BR>
*** Let's go over the basics first. bps means "bits per second".  Bps means "bytes per second". There are 8 bits per Byte. Chances
are your "traffic" monitor is reporting in Bps but your ISP advertised in bps. So:
<P>
1.5Mbps DSL = 1,500,000 bits per second = 187,500 Bytes per second 
<P>
56K Modem = 56,000 bits per second or 7,000 Bytes per second
<P>
My cable modem average = 925,000 bits per second = 115,600 Bytes per second
<P>
Often tho, I only get 600,000 bits per second at popular download sites.  Other times even way less.  Your download speed is dependent on the quality of the server you are downloading from and the number of jumps the file has to make along the way. For
example, it's not uncommon for a download to have to go through 10 computers before it gets to your computer.  Combine that with
an "overloaded" source webpage server and one can easily see how your actual download speed could be way less than the 
promised "maximum download at up to" statement. 
<P>
Randy O. added:
<P>
Transfer will only be as fast as the slowest connection in the chain.

<P>
My name is Borislav, and for some time now I am on your mailing list. I think that your list is very helpful, and this mail is some sort 
of my contribution.
<P>
Every day there is one user of mobile computer more, and one user of classic desktop computer less. But, as power of mobile 
computer have risen, also the level of noise is higher and battery drains faster. Notebook hardware control program below:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.pbus-167.com/chc.htm">http://www.pbus-167.com/chc.htm</A>
<P>
Is a fantastic little utility that allows user of supported laptops to reduce level of noise on their laptops and to prolong battery life.  I am using this little util for half year now (on ASUS M6Ne), and for most part of time only faint sound of my HDD spinning is heard. Except CPU control, voltage lowering, better  speed  stepping than default, etc., there is also control of your ATI card. By automatic lowering your ATI card clock you can gain to almost one hour of battery time with no slowness at all working in Windows. Also, there is battery control, fan on/off control, HDD ACPI checking every ten minutes, HDD speed control (I would suggest to put your hard disk to fastest settings, as noise with lower set will be slightly lower, but speed significantly decreased). 
<P>
On some laptops NHC may not work.  Also please note that program is still in BETA, but if it  works you are one lucky laptop owner. 
You also have to have Microsoft NET Framework 2.0  installed for this program to work. 
<P><BR>
*** IMPORTANT NOTE: This is NOT one of those utils you just install and start to play around with without reading and understanding 
the docs first and making sure you know the potential consequences of adjusting things like fan speed, etc.

<STRONG><font color="red">6) Office 97 Updates</font></STRONG>
<P>
Rah asked - Since we installed XP at work, things just don't seem the same with our decrepit Word 97.  [For example, among other
niggles], when we try and copy and paste text or images into a document it freezes with the Not Responding message.  
<P>
R. M. responded:<BR>
Is Office 97 fully updated?  Office 97 isn't supported via Office Update/Microsoft Update so patches/SP's must be applied manually.
<P>
The list of available updates found here:<BR>
<A HREF="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdate/CD010226191033.aspx">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdate/CD010226191033.aspx</A>
<P>
Service Release 2-b would be the most important update to apply.
<P><BR>
*** Office 97 "should" work out of the box on an XP PC even tho it's ten years old. My guess is that Rah upgraded win98 pcs to
XP, instead of installing XP fresh, as recommended.  Of course, in an office environment the best option may be to upgrade, rather
than install fresh. In that case uninstalling/reinstalling Office or other apps may work, or one may have to purchase a more recent
version.

[Error number: 0x8DDD0002]<BR>
To install updates from this website, you must be logged on as an administrator or a member of the Administrators group on your computer.  If you use Windows XP, you can see if you are an administrator by going to User Accounts in Control Panel.
