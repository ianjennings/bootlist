<STRONG><font color="red">1) Can You Force Explorer To Ignore File Copy Errors?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Tony posted - Not to ask too stupid a question, but is there a way to get Windows Explorer (the file 
manager, not Internet Explorer the Internet browser) to continue coping if it finds an error?  In other words 
to act like xcopy's "/c" option?
<P>
stealth answered:<BR>
Unfortunately: NO
<P>
Patrick K. suggested:<BR>
I'll suggest instead using FileSync. Which will indeed keep copying, and keep track.
<P>

<P><BR>
*** To save you time doing a xcopy /? to find out what the /c option is - it's just an option to keep on
copying files even if an error is encountered during the process.

<P>
I have also found a problem of Win98 networking of a different type. 
<P>
On many installations with Ethernet card & cables functioning properly forget about browsing the network even the local machine is invisible. To solve this problem I simply have to logoff + logon & the network neighborhood comes up nice & proper.

mhsmom asked - What's the difference between formatting "ntfs" or "ntfs quick" other than the obvious (speed)?
<P>
Carey F. answered:<BR>
Differences between a Quick format and a regular format during a "clean" installation of Windows XP:

A quick format creates the file system structure on the volume without verifying the integrity of every 
sector in the volume, which increases the formatting speed. If the volume is already formatted and you 
are sure the disk is not damaged, you can use this option. A full format identifies and tracks bad sectors 
so that they are not used for storing data.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Out Of Memory Message While Doing A Full Format</font></STRONG>
<P>
James M. telephoned - I was having major problems with my computer so I decided to format it and
start from scratch with my Windows 98 boot disk. I'm going to put XP on afterwards but I want a 60 gig
FAT32 partition for XP so this is the only way to do it since XP will not allow greater than 32 gig FAT32
partitions unless you set them up first in Dos. My problem is that I get an "Out of memory" message while 
formatting and it stops. 
<P><BR>
*** The problem you are having is probably due to a bad hard drive. When using a bootdisk to format
you are limited to the the basic 640K of ram thereabouts. So, even tho format.com and the associated
running apps loaded with the bootdisk hardly use any ram, when you do a full format it tries to save 
"bad sector" data in ram to write it to the drive after the format is complete. If you have a lot, or just too 
many bad sectors than you run out of ram to temporarily save the data to. 
<P>
In this case you can try a zero fill, or the hard drive repair utility from your hard drive maker to see if it can
fix the problems with your hard drive. And then try format again. 
<P>
Chances are tho, since James was having major problems before, he may have just uncovered the root 
of the problem. 
<P>
As a review, the basic 640K or 655,360 Bytes of ram is called Conventional Memory. [640K X 1,024 Bytes
per K = 655,360]. Anybody remember tweaking config.sys and/or autoexec.bat to get more free
conventional ram to run those dos games?

<P>
oldad inquired - Before XPS Pro (Win 95,98,98SE) I always had a TweakUI icon in Control Panel.  Now I 
do not and have tried everything I could think of to add it. No luck.  Dell Tech with Dell XPS Elite Support Group, now outsourced to India, says impossible.  Is it possible to put one in control panel?

[the] items I never use?
