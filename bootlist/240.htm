<STRONG><font color="red">2) Run XP From A CD To Stop Abuse?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Wowbagger posted - Can XP Pro be run off of a CD ROM with a local HDD used for swap and other 
temporary files?  There are a couple of specific windows applications that need to be run on the machine, but nothing particularly taxing or rooted too deeply in the registry.
<P>
I want something that will let me put a CD in the drive, boot, have the computer up and running, take all 
kinds of abuse by users who don't know any better then at night remove the CD from the drive and lock it 
up, ready to start over the next morning with a clean slate. Is such a configuration possible?
<P>
Malke suggested:<BR>
No, you cannot run XP from a "live" cd like one of the many live Linux cd's,  Knoppix for example. From 
your description, the program Deep Freeze from Faronics would suit your needs exactly:

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Not Really A Kazaa Article</font></STRONG>
<P>
Dr. Lederman phoned - My son has Kazaa and some file he got from it messed up our laptop.  So I called a 
a computer at-home service to fix it. The young man removed Kazaa with a special program he had but 
now the laptop cant get on the Internet. He said he'll be back in a day or 2 but I cant wait that long. 
<P>
I can use my other PC to get to Internet. What should I try?
<P><BR>
*** The young fix-it geek most likely used a spyware cleaner or the special Kazaa removal utility. Often,
when removing spyware and/or programs that include spyware  you may lose your Internet connection. 
<P>
For example, if the tech used KazaaBegone he probably didn't read the part that said you will need
lspfix to repair the winsock2 afterwards. KazaaBegone is at the bottom of the page along with a link to
lspfix.zip:

Two other repair utilities are here which may also be used if your anti-spyware applicaion eg. adaware
or spybot removes the nasties but leaves you unable to connect.

If you have a single pc in you home you might want to download these files in advance, just in case your
anti-spyware app leaves you with no internet access afterwards. FYI I dont blame the removal utilities
at all. Spyware damage is just like virus damage. You may kill the bugs, but still have repair work to do
afterwards. Sort of like termite damage in your home I suppose :)

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Hard Time Getting To Safe Mode</font></STRONG>
<P>
BrandonA asked - I need to get into safe mode in XP Pro to roll-back a defunct video driver. But F8 isn't working. Any thoughts?
<P>
Torgeir B. replies:<BR>
You did tap F8 repeatedly early in the computer/Windows startup process?
<P>
If F8 doesn't work, you could add the switch /SAFEBOOT:MINIMAL in your Boot.ini file, and then reboot.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) OE And Compacting Files</font></STRONG>
<P>
Bill T. questioned -  Is there a way to stop outlook express from nagging you to compact the files? I have a large disk drive and feel no need to do the compacting. Is my thinking wrong to not want this?
<P>
Frank S. answered:<BR>
You really do need to let OE compact the folders or they will grow to the point OE won't work at all.  Say 
Yes and leave the computer alone until it finishes.
<P>
PA Bear said:<BR>
No and yes. You can't stop OE from compacting automatically every 100 times you close it. You can tell
OE to stop asking you about it by checking the "Don't ask me again" prompt, but then Automatic 
Compacting will still take place but without warning you.
<P>
General OE Caveats:
<P>
- Don't use Inbox or Sent Items to archive messages.  Move them to local folders created for this purpose.
<P>
- Empty Deleted Items folder daily.
<P>
- Disable Background Compacting [N/A in SP2] and frequently perform a manual compact of all OE 
folders while "working offline".  More at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.insideoe.com/files/maintain.htm">http://www.insideoe.com/files/maintain.htm</A>
<P>
- Do not attempt to close OE via Task Manager or shutdown your machine if Automatic Compacting is 
taking place (WinXP SP2 only).
<P>
- Your anti-virus application's email scanning feature can also cause corruption.  Disable it.  It provides no additional protection.
<P>
Frank S. added:<BR>
OETool has a Compact All button that will reset OE's counter.  You can use this to compact at a more convenient time.
