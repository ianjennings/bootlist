<P>
Moon said - Just about to rebuild and was wondering if there are still issues with some of the intellipoint software and xpsp2? I have a natural keyboard pro and an optical [MS] Intellimouse. [Where do I get the
correct drivers?]
<P>
Jim B. responds:<BR>
Your system can be very sensitive to having the exactly correct Intellipoint software for the specific
mouse you use.  Go here and do the selection process (Carefully!):

*** In other words, there aren't issues, just niggles in getting the correct drivers. Personally I still like using
mice and keyboards here at home that DO NOT require special drivers. Why complicate your life?

<P>
Shiva posted - I recently found that my folders are not retaining their view settings. View all folders and remember folder settings have been duly checked. This started to happen only recently. Does not bother
me but is intriguing. A thorough check for mal-ware was made - none found.
<P>
Phil answers:<BR>
XP [Original] only remembers 400 folder views by default. To have it remember more:
<P>
First download and install the fix to make xp remember more than 8000 folders:<BR>

<P>
Then, in explorer, set your view as you like and go to: tools, folder options, view tab, apply to all folders.
Also make sure to check: remember each folder's view settings.
<P>
Will D. adds:<BR>
The folder settings limit have been increased to 5000 in SP2.

<P>
ryan asked - When I press ctrl+alt+delete the only box that pops up is the graph that  show the percent of 
cpu usage.  I cant access the other tabs that show the programs running, etc.  How do I get these back? 
<P>
Ken B. relies:<BR>
You're running in what's called Small Footprint Mode.  To change back and forth from this mode to 
regular mode, just double-click on the border.

<P>
Jess F. inquired - I have a gazillion files in Explorer  in folders named FOUND. What are they (dumps?) 
and can I nuke them?
<P>
Will D. answers:<BR>
I think you'll find they are folders created by chkdsk. 
<P>
R. McCarty says:<BR>
The are recovered fragments, that result from a run of Chkdsk. Similar to the FATxx type of Cross-Linked 
files and other data disjointed from the allocation table.  Continued recovery of these data pieces may 
indicate an issue with your disk drive. If you [have] irreplaceable data [that] isn't backed up, do it today.
<P><BR>
*** Can often be caused by bad or incompatible ram as well right after you add it.  Yes the files can be 
nuked.  When you tweak your ram problem they can/should go away [eg not be generated] assuming it 
was due to ram that XP and/or your motherboard didn't like. They can also be generated by shutting
down your PC improperly.
