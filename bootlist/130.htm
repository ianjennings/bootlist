<STRONG><font color="red">1) Difference Between XP Upgrade And Full Version</font></STRONG>
<P>
John C. asks - Besides the cost, what is the difference between xp upgrade and xp full version? 
<P>
Carey F. answers:<BR>
Both versions are identical except for the fact the upgrade version requires a Windows 98/ME/2000 
installation CD if you desire to perform a "clean install.  A "full version" does not have this requirement.
However, the cheaper "OEM full version" cannot upgrade over an existing Windows installation....only 
"retail full versions" can.
<P>
Ken B. also says:<BR>
The software itself is identical. Only the rules for how it can be used are different.
<P>
The full version can be used for either an upgrade or clean installation. The upgrade can too, but for a 
clean installation it requires that you have a previous qualifying version's CD to insert as proof of of 
ownership when prompted to do so.
<P>
Also note that there is a third type--an OEM version. Many people confuse this with the full version. 
However an OEM version can not do an upgrade at all.
<P><BR>
*** Of course there are exceptions where an OEM version can do an upgrade. Reason being, there are a
few flavors of OEM versions around eg large PC makers sometimes sell/provide these type of "special
OEM" disks with their PCs.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) My HP OEM XP CD Wont Work With New Motherboard</font></STRONG>
<P>
Dave posts - I have an HP Pavilion that the mainboard failed on.  I replaced the mainboard with a board 
that is not HP.  The Home xp volume was damaged and I tried to repair it using the repair console.  It 
didn't help.  I re installed xp with a xp upgrade that I have and the activation key is invalid.  I tried a Hp 
recovery cd but it wont run because the board is not hp.
<P>
purplehaz replies:<BR>
You [have] an oem version of xp. This version is sometimes bios locked (like yours is) and also is not 
allowed to transfer to another motherboard/computer. This is one of the many downfalls of buying oem
[versions of Windows XP]. 
<P>
Since you replaced your motherboard you will have to buy a retail version of xp and install that. The oem 
cd will not work with the new mb cause it is bios locked. If you already purchased a license from MS you 
can't use that product key with your oem cd, you need a retail cd cause ms doesn't sell oem product keys. 
<P>
If you bought a product key from ms and have a xp retail cd or you just bought xp retail version from the 
store and it says the product key is invalid you will have to call MS to straighten that out.
<P><BR>
*** As a review, the bios is a rectangular chip on your motherboard that runs 24/7 off the motherboard
battery even if you have  your PC in storage. To minimize distribution of illegal copies of MS OS CDs, 
Microsoft is partnered with large PC makers whereby a proprietary XP cd is produced that is "married" to 
a particular model of PC.  The goal is to prevent one from using the OEM XP CD on other computers. 
<P>

[To add,  if you] go back and research the HP'S XP system and  I'm sure that you will find that the 
recovery CD(s) are not shipped with  the new PCs and every where I've been on here it's telling that I've 
got to go back to the manufacturer and order the HP  XP  Recovery Kit for the 550n PC....that consist of 6 to 
7 CDs.
<P><BR>
*** The ol' rock and hard place. Many brands do put the PCs original "restore to factory fresh" files in a 
hidden partition on the hard drive and don't supply any OS CDs at all.  So if your hard drive fails, you're
now looking at additional cost and time for a set of CDs or are faced with buying an official MS CD and
possibly locating device drivers, which may or may not be easily found for such proprietary systems 
even on the HP website as they really want to resell you the OS and setup disks.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) CD Autoplay No Longer Works</font></STRONG>
<P>
Danny wrote - My PC used to detect when I loaded a CD into the system.  Somehow this has been 
disabled...ie, when I put a CD into the CD tray and close the tray, Windows XP does nothing anymore.  
Now I can still use the CD drive for I/O without any problem...but I used to be prompted when I loaded a 
CD onto the system and I found that very useful and helpful, and I would like to know how to turn it back 
on.
<P>
William G. suggests:<BR>
[Try the easy thing first.] Right click on the CD Drive icon and go to properties and go to the Autoplay tab.
<P>
Michael P. writes back:<BR>
This feature is called Autoplay.  There is a way to turn this feature on or off via the registry; some software 
can affect it as well.  The following article discusses troubleshooting this:

330135 The AutoRun or AutoPlay Feature Does Not Work:<BR>
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=330135">http://support.microsoft.com/?id=330135</A>
<P><BR>
*** As Michael said, some software can pretty much totally disable that feature. Often its CD burning
software, and no matter what you do, you cant get the feature back.  The bad thing is, there are many
CDs that dont have a setup.exe and in fact require autoplay to be working for their install app to run.
<P>
In these cases, you might have to force autoplay to work manually, using a util called cd-eject:<BR>

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Need XP SP1 On Disk</font></STRONG>
<P>
Ruth inquires - I had big problems with my PC and ended up loading my recovery disk on my computer 
using the disk provided to me when I bought it 2 yrs ago.  This factory setting disk is in place of a drivers 
and windows disks to prevent fraud.
<P>
I'm having top download all my windows updates on my computer again.  Is there any way I can save 
Service Pack 1 onto disk so I don't have this problem if I have to start from scratch again?
<P><BR>
*** You can download the "network installation" sp1 from here and save it to a cd:<BR>

tiki2k posts - XP Pro wont turn machine off after shutting down. I checked "Power" in Control Panel but 
there's no APM setting. APM is enabled in the BIOS. When I had Win98 on this machine, it always turned completely off. Is there a setting somewhere in XP?

Poweroff at Shutdown<BR>
If your computer does not turn off the power when doing a shutdown (even though you have the correct 
BIOS and Power settings), you may need to edit the registry.
<P>
Start | Run<BR>
Then type  Regedit
<P>
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop<BR>
Edit the key PowerOffActive and give it a value of 1<BR>
You can do the same in HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop
<P>
Note you can save the registry key first by:<BR>
On the File menu, click Export.<BR>
In the File name box, type SaveKey, and then click  Save.<BR>
Or create a system restore point prior to editing.<BR>
Note: If the registry key is not there, you can simply create one by going edit | new.
