Mikey wrote - I have added another drive to my unit through a scsi card, as this is not the c: drive I did not foresee any problems. 
When I rebooted the system it told me I have three days to activate "no problem" I thought. When I try to activate my system nothing happens, the keys on the taskbar disappear but the wizard does not start, there fore I have no phone numbers to contact.

Ron M. replied:<BR>
Try repairing the registry entries for the .DLL files used by activation.
<P>
Use Start | Run and enter the following text in the dialog box:<BR>
regsvr32.exe regwizc.dll
<P>
Then do it again with the following text:<BR>
regsvr32.exe licdll.dll
<P>
Launch activation manually:<BR>
%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\oobe\msoobe.exe /A

Sean asked - How do I set my numlock keys to ON after start-up. DELL 470 Precision workstation/ Win XP Pro.  System start-up 
options Numlock is on, but doesn't activate during start-up. What do I need to change?

<P>
Malke suggested:<BR>
XP, like most modern operating systems (OSX, Linux) doesn't pay any attention to the Numlock setting in the BIOS. Log into an 
account and turn Numlock on or off as desired. Windows will now remember that setting the next time you log into that account. If you need Numlock to be on *before* you've logged into an account, see:

<P>
OK here's the story. My wife went to Best Buy to pick out a present for me in the computer section. Even tho I had not asked for 
anything computer related she figured an LCD Monitor would make a good surprise gift. I've been using the same pair of 15" CRTs
for 8 years on top of my circa 1920s Roll Down Oak desk ie the kind with all those pigeon hole drawers.  
<P>
She "heard" that the "brighter" the display the better, and yes, if you go to a retail store you'll notice that all the LCDs are turned up
all the way to 100% brightness. There were no prices on the units the on the 24th, so she picked out the three brightest displays and 
took them to the checkout counter and bought the cheapest one of the three. It was a Westinghouse 15" Model LCM-15v5. 
<P>
I was pretty surprised. I didn't even know Westinghouse made LCD computer monitors. Heck, there are none listed at newegg.com.  
Not one to "fix what aint broke", I first hooked it up temporarily and the cables were far better quality than I've seen on other brands.
As soon as I turned it on, I was hooked. It was brighter than any LCD I had seen. So bright in fact, that I actually have the brightness
turned down to ZERO and it's fine, and the blacks, even when brightness turned all the way up, are still black as black. As you
may know I'm a sucker for a black background on a webpage.

<P>
Yes of course brightness isn't everything, but for me it's important as well as the crispness of the display. Tomorrow or so I'll hook
up the audio cable and get rid of that pair of speakers taking up my valuable "real" desktop space.
