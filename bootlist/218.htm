DaveH inquires - Is there a way to create a log of every action taken during a boot?  I see an option in 
Boot.ini in MSCONFIG and selected it once but couldn't find a file.  I need to determine some problems 
I'm having. 
<P>
David C.  said:<BR>
It's called ntbtlog.txt in windows.
<P>
Sharon F adds:<BR>
Look for an ntbtlog.txt file in your Windows directory. 
<P>
An alternative way of performing this task is to press F8 during boot (after POST and before Windows 
starts to load). Select "Enable Boot Logging" from the advanced start menu that will appear.

Jim wrote - Recently when I try to open a new window in Internet Explorer the window wont open.  The 
program just hangs.  This happens both when I right-click and choose 'open in new window' and when I 
click a link that is supposed to open a new window on its own -- the window just hangs ,and I have to use
task manager to close it.

jrbyrd suggests:<BR>
Go to Start|Run and enter "regsvr32 /i urlmon.dll" (without the quotes).  After you get a Success message, 
re-boot.  If that doesn't work, then check out the following article and do the additional steps outlined there:

dave posted - I've just purchased a new hard drive and my coa licence wont work keeps saying 
incorrect key but its definitely the one on my sticker.
<P>
Bruce C. responds:<BR>
You need to examine the Product Key very carefully.  It's awfully easy to mistake a "B" for an "8," a "G" for 
a "6," an "S" for a "5," or a "Q" for a "0" or "O."  Fortunately, Microsoft had the good sense to leave the 
"1's",  "I's", "O's", and "0's" out of the equation.   Also, be sure that your CapsLock [Key] is _off_  while 
entering the Product Key -- This isn't supposed to make a difference, but I've seen it do so, on rare 
occasions.

mike76 needs - How can I set windows explorer (XP) so that the same directories and sub directories 
appear each time windows explorer loads?
<P>
Bruce C. answers:<BR>
Basically, all you need do is modify the target field of your Windows Explorer shortcut to point where you 
want it.  For example:
<P> 
"%SystemRoot%\explorer.exe /e ,c:\" (without the quotes) would open Explorer at the root of the C: drive.
