Jerry posts - I'm using Windows XP and have new DSL service. How can I find my IP address?
<P>
Burt answers:<BR>
This is one way:
<P>
Go to START/RUN and type in cmd and in the new window you will see a blinking cursor and you will 
type in:
<P>
ipconfig /all and hit ENTER key. This will show you your entire IP address.
<P>
You can also hit: <BR>

and it will tell you your IP Address

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Can Old Deleted Files Be Recovered?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Vivian asks -  Thank you for such an easy [website] to [help me] fix my computer.  Although I have a 
question.  I had some videos of my children at the swimming pool about a year ago and had transferred 
them to my zip drive.  Upon doing that, I deleted them and my zip [disk] later turned up missing.  I was wondering if restoration 2.x [or any other undeleter] would be able to bring about those files that I had 
deleted, and also emptied from the recycling bin.
<P><BR>
*** The longer you've been using any pc you have deleted files on that you want back the slimmer your 
chances are of recovering them. Why? Because once you delete a file your pc sees that space on your 
hard drive as available and will write new files to that area eg files from software installs, temporary 
internet files, temp files, and so on. 
<P>
Or, if you've defragged that will fill in ALL the space starting at the beginning of the drive thus overwriting
every [potentially recoverable] file that was deleted if it resided in that area. 
<P>
In summary, file recovery software works best if you immediately shut down your pc once you discover 
the error. 
<P>
Ken B. responds:<BR>
Deleting a file doesn't actually delete it; it just marks the space as available to be used. There are 
third-party programs that can sometimes recover deleted files. The problem is that the space used by 
the file is likely to become overwritten very quickly, and this makes the file unrecoverable.
<P>
So your chances of successfully recovering this file is decent if you try recovering it immediately after 
deleting it, and rapidly go downhill from there. If you've been using the computer since then (for example 
to write this question and read this answer), your chances are probably very poor by now.
<P>
But if the file is important enough, it's worth a try anyway. Stop using the computer in question immediately,
if you haven't done so already. Download an undelete program. Here's one: 
<P>
<A HREF="http://www3.telus.net/mikebike/RESTORATION.html">http://www3.telus.net/mikebike/RESTORATION.html</A>
<P>
But there are several others to choose from; do a Google search) on a friend's computer and bring it to
yours on a floppy to try.
<P>
If this fails, your only other recourse is to take the drive to a professional file recovery company. This kind 
of service is very expensive and may or may not work in your case.
<P>
t.cruise adds:<BR>
AND, your results will vary, depending upon how much you've used the drive since you lost the data.  You might only be able to recover portions of files, and not the whole file
itself, or not be able to recover certain files at all.  The rule of thumb is to use the system as little as 
possible, until you recover what you need.
<P>
Otherwise, the drive sectors that contain the files might be overwritten.  I once deleted about 200 JPG files.
By the time I recovered them with EasyRecovery, I was only able to fully recover about 80 of the files.  
The other 120 files were either only partially recoverable, with 1/3 to 1/2 of the image viewable, or not 
recoverable at all.  So, timely recovery is VERY important.
<P><BR>
***  The Restoration utility mentioned above will install to/work off a floppy so you dont take the chance of 
writing the program to your hard drive and possibly overwriting some data you need to recover. The app. 
below you might want to install in advance of any problem in case you need to use it later.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) How To Remove Already Deleted Program Listings From Add/Remove</font></STRONG>
<P>
Dan writes - I installed a program and I tried using add/remove programs to remove the file, but error 
came up saying, cannot find INSTALL.log. The program has been deleted [manually, but it's] still in the 
program list. How do I remove the program listing?
<P>
To reinstall the program means reinstall eZula and other Spyware programs along with it. This I do not 
want to go back through.
<P>
Kelly answers:<BR>
This generally means that you removed the program folder, etc prior to using Add or Remove or the 
uninstaller.  Use the steps provided here:

<P><BR>
*** True, it's much easier to just remove the program listing from the registry instead of following the 
advice you often see from folks that suggest you install the program again just to get the uninstall to work.
Yes there are a few utilities that can do this for you but its one of the safest registry edits as all you are
doing is removing a nonactive key.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Get Rid Of Juno's IE Toolbar</font></STRONG>
<P>
Martha asks - I have a dialup ISP which is Juno. I use the pay for version which is $10/month. I like it I but it 
put in this toolbar in my Internet Explorer which I dont want. Is there an easy way to get rid of it without 
going into the registry as my computer guy friend said I should do?  
<P><BR>
*** Make sure IE is closed. Go to the folder you installed Juno to most likely in Program Files and rename
toolbar.dll to toolbar.bak or whatever.  When it's gone IE will run faster also.
