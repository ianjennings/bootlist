<STRONG><font color="red">1) Discover ****** Passwords</font></STRONG>
<P>
PC Pete asks - I often have to redo peoples PCS often just because they want a fresh install and I know 
from experience to get their passwords before I format because they dont remember them is there any 
utility you recommend that can get most of the important ones like logon to internet passwords that are 
shown as ******** in case my customers cant remember their passwords?
<P><BR>
*** I know the deal. Folks often dont write them down and it's 11:30 at night and yes you want to make sure
your customers can get back on the internet before you leave. Best time to get the passwords is before 
you do the drastic format. Yes it's true lots of folks just want to start out new with a clean running system 
even tho it's still working OK.  Heck I like the new car feeling also at times :)
<P>
Note the below utils wont reveal EVERY ******* password but should get the most important ones.

Matt wrote - Hi I need to install a couple of new hard drives to my computer for storage.  However my IDE 
slots are all filled up. My motherboard supports SATA connections, I haven't seen them advertised 
anywhere but can I buy SATA - IDE adaptor so I can use it with some old IDE hard drives I have.

Here are a couple such converters:

<P>
They can be useful in certain situations like if you have one of the newest motherboards that only have a 
single IDE channel in conjunction with SATA controllers. If you have an existing ATA drive you want to 
use along with a couple of optical drives, or other IDE devices, then you can end up short on connections. These little adapters came out as soon as the first SATA controller cards hit the market a couple years 
ago. 
<P>
[There isn't] much to them actually. It owes to the backward compatibility with ATA command structure in 
order for SATA to be fully compatible with the ATA storage drivers in windows, I would surmise. The 
largest difference is really just in the method used to get the data piped over the cabling. This is easily 
adapted with the little converter board.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) XP CD Wont Boot On My New PC</font></STRONG>
<P>
Murray posts - I just bought a new PC for myself for Christmas and it wont boot from my Real MS XP CD. I 
know the CD is good as my other computers can boot from it. I have set the bios to boot from the CD first 
but still no joy so what is the problem I did not go for the floppy drive to save a few dollars. I do have some
other bootable CDS and it boots from some of them but not others so what is up? 
<P><BR>
*** Any computer you build or buy MUST still have a floppy disk drive for such a common niggle as you
describe. Install one. Bootable CDs are still not yet totally perfected nor are they guaranteed to work on 
all pcs, even brand new ones.  
<P>
Or look at it this way. It's a nice option to have 2 bootable drives on a pc right? Bootable USB/Memory 
Stick is not yet standardized so get that 3 1/2 floppy disk with your new pc. Or if you dont have one they 
are less than $20. It's no wonder why sales of 1.44 floppy disk drives are still climbing. 
<P>
Or look at it another way.  Suppose you have to call a tech out to fix your pc. He/She will hope on the ride
over to your home that you have a floppy drive installed. If not, then you may be looking at another hour or
so of service time that you have to pay for to get your computer fixed.

Migas is breakfast!!!<BR>
Recipe for Migas<BR>
4 eggs<BR>
1 tablespoon water<BR>
1 tablespoon salsa<BR>
1 tablespoon bacon drippings or vegetable oil<BR>
1/4 cup chopped onion<BR>
1/2 to 1 fresh jalape�o, minced<BR>
12 to 16 tostada chips, broken<BR>
1/2 cup grated Cheddar or Monterey jack cheese<BR>
2 teaspoons minced cilantro (optional)
<P>
Beat eggs lightly with water and salsa. Set aside.
<P>
In a cast iron skillet warm bacon drippings over medium heat. Add onion and
jalape�o, saut�ing them until limp. Pour in eggs and stir them up from the
bottom of the skillet as they cook. About a minute before the eggs are
done, add the chips, stirring them in well. Remove the eggs from the heat,
and stir in the cheese, reserving a little to scatter over the top.
Sprinkle the cilantro over the eggs, if you like.
<P>
Serve the migas immediately with warm flour tortillas and more salsa or
picant� sauce.
<P>
Migas may also be cooked by scrambling eggs, then warming the eggs and
chips in warm ranchero sauce.
