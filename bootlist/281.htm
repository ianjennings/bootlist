Jacques asked - When I click on Windows Explorer, it always start with "My Documents" selected. Can it start with "My Computer" selected or Local Disk C:  instead?

<P><BR>
*** It's best not fix what isn't broken especially for cosmetic issues. You can find yourself in a huge jam that could take days to fix and
possibly a reinstall of Windows and loss of all your personal files.

<P>
Richard inquired - When my Windows XP Home Edition restarts it goes to a black screen that says: Windows root system32\hal.dll 
file missing. Reinstall file.  What do I need to do to reinstall this file?
<P><BR>
***That's generally an incorrect error message as your hal.dll file is most likely just fine and in the right place.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Password Manager</font></STRONG>
<P>
Phil asked -  I am looking for an online password manager utility.  I want it to be online because I would like to be able to use the password manager from either my work, 1st home, or 2nd home PC, or when traveling and trying to use someone else's computer.
<P>
I would also like to hear your feedback on whether or not this is a good idea, i.e.: possible security comprised due to using an online password utility, etc.
<P><BR>
*** Pick up a steno book and keep your user names and passwords in it. Way safer and easier than keeping them on a hard drive in a separate program. An online option is even worse as the system admin can access it anytime he/she wants to. Make a copy of the many pages and put it in another location in your home. 
<P>
I also travel a lot and dont take my steno book with me as I only need to remember my most important user names/passwords or just use write them to a small card and keep them in my wallet. If my wallet gets stolen the thief wont know what my writing means anyway.

Ken B. adds:<BR>
If it were me in your shoes, I would feel safer not trusting any on-line site with something like this. I would prefer to use a thumb drive 
that I could carry with me.
