The One wants to know - Does anyone know of a good program to enter text onto a PDF Acrobat Reader 
file.

Yes, PDF995 works with Windows XP and newer versions of MS Word. It's been updated.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) My CPU Is Running Too Hot</font></STRONG>
<P>
David posted - I need to cool my CPU (running at 70 degrees C ish). The PC freezes when it is raised to 
about 75 due to the power drain from my USB scanner and/or heat from my hard drive when being 
accessed constantly.
<P>
The Motherboard Monitor software shows only 1 fan is operating. So either I have only 1 fan or a second 
one not working (probably the CPU cooling fan). Are these easy to change / install?  How do I go about 
it?
<P><BR>
*** The motherboard monitor will only report fans that are connected to the motherboard for their power. It 
wont report video card fans, case fans that are not connected to the motherboard, or power supply fans
in most cases. 
<P>
If you do have a case fan connected to the motherboard than that may have failed. Thus the reason you
said "only one fan is operating". Or you simply dont have any other fans except for the power supply fan. If 
the cpu fan wasn't operating at all chances are you wouldn't even last five minutes using the pc.  You 
really have to take the cover off the computer and check for yourself. 
<P>
Or, case fans can also be connected to a 4 pin PS line which your motherboard monitor will not pick up.
<P>
All but the power supply fans are very easy to replace. Although some cpu fansinks require some skill
with a screwdriver and/or long nose pliers to unhook it from the cpu holder without damaging the hook or motherboard.  Note that the power supply fan also acts as a case fan to cool the system.
<P>
On the other hand, your cpu fan may be working but if the case and/or power supply fan isn't than the 
internal case temperature can get too hot and cause the same types of lockups one sees if only the cpu 
fan is not functioning properly. 
<P>
Or, the cpu fan may be working fine but the heatsink below it is filled with dust. The fan will actually pack
down the dust and grime resulting in poor cooling as you describe. 
<P>
When you buy new case fans you can get either the 3 pin type that connect to the motherboard or the 4 pin
type that connect to a spare standard power supply lead. Note that if you get the 3 pin flavor make sure 
there is a place to plug it in on the motherboard. You'll often have to look at the manual for the location
of any fan ports ie just dont plug it in to any 3 pin connector. Personally I like the 4 pin type as they can go 
into any system and most folks aren't in the habit of checking the bios for fan operation anyway. 
<P>
Power supply fans can be 2 pin, 3 pin, or 4 pin, or just soldered on the circuit board. To replace it you first
have to take the power supply out and then remove the power supply cover. A person good with wiring
can easily replace any PS fan as they are generally the same size as a standard case fan. 
<P>
Personally if the power supply fan goes bad I like to replace the entire unit with something generally
more powerful. PS's dont last forever, and if you do have the funds it's a good time to get a new one. 
Luckily modern PS units have way more reliable fans then what you may have seen with the Pentium II
and III era pcs. 
<P>
In closing its a real good habit to take your cover off at least twice a year and check the fans and blow 
out all the dust.

<P>
Captain Infinity asks - Is there a way to turn off the Delete File Confirmation in Windows Explorer?  I'm 
doing a lot of cleanup on a number of workstations and clicking that darn "Yes" box after every file 
deletion is driving me nuts.
<P>
Torgeir B. said:<BR>
Right-click on your Recycle Bin and select "Properties".
<P>
Under the "Global tab", remove the checkmark for "Display delete confirmation dialog", then click "OK".

<P>
Joy questions - How does one delete a file that Norton says is a virus, when access is denied?  Norton 
says "Unable to repair" and "Access to file is denied".  
<P>
ChloeAnn suggests:<BR>
Here is a toll free number to Microsoft to help with viruses 1-866-727-2338.  There is no charge for them 
helping you and they are the safest to ask when a virus is in the picture.  I have called them a couple of 
times and they have always been very nice and helpful to me.

Alan A. wrote - I realize SP2 in XP reduces the number of TCP connections per second to 10 (unlimited in 
SP1).  The problem is that some legitimate apps require more than ten.  This problem is not wide spread 
as I have a few XP boxes that don't display this problem.  However, we've come across a couple of 
machines that do.
<P>
I understand there is a patch to fix this, but I have yet to see on on Microsoft's site.  Searching the 
knowledge base for Event ID 4226 turns up nothing.
