<P>
Tim.T asked - When you open a "SaveAs" or "Open" dialogue box in Explorer, there are options down the left hand side panel for 
places to save/open  the file: Recent, Desktop, MyDocuments, MyComputer, and My  Network. I was just wondering if there are any registry hacks to let you add other folders, drives, to this panel.

to install it. What gives? 
<P><BR>
*** Most commonly its a bad download. eg that message usually means the file was corrupted during download, or, could NOT be
saved to your pc correctly.  It often happens when file servers are too busy, [overloaded] or low quality. Or, it can happen if you just 
have too many background apps running, esp. apps that phone home [often spyware] while you download a large file, tho less rare. 
<P>
Try again from a different download server, and make sure to delete your Internet cache and temp/tmp folders. And make sure
your pc is spyware free.  Also, many webmasters are now doing pages where they recommend NOT using a download manager
as that can mess up the download. For example, see the "Please note" on this page:

<P>
In summary, if you get a CRC error, it generally means one or several "packets" have been lost. More on packets here:

<P>
To put it in laymans terms, When a file is "shipped" to somebody, its NOT all shipped in a single big box. Rather, it's broken up into
many thousands of tiny boxes, and if only a single tiny box is lost during shipment, the full file cannot be reconstructed properly on 
your PC.

Littlejoe posted - Just switched to Adobe Reader 7.0  and loaded the upgrade 7.0.7. Every time  get an attachment Adobe locks up 
and wants me to send an error report to windows. I have to reboot to unlock system. [Im running Windows XP].

RDS said:<BR>
The best thing you could do is remove Adobe and install the free Foxit PDF Reader.  It's less than half the size and starts up in a 
fraction of a second:

JAmes commented:<BR>
May I suggest that you uninstall Reader 7.0 and then go to the Adobe web site to download Reader and say that you are only 
running Windows 98.  They will then allow you to only download Reader 6.0.  Reader 7.0 is very flakey!

<P>
Lamont questions - For some strange reason, my computer, which I have had for almost 4 years, will no longer save downloaded 
files. It goes through the motions..., download progress, green dots displaying download is active, but the file never shows in any of 
my folders. I tried to save to desktop to be certain I wasn't imagining the problem.  Still, the symptoms persist. I am wondering if the recently updated "Windows Defender" will have changed my security status. I do have admin rights.

*** Best to try out BETA software on a non-critical PC you dont need for everyday use.

Paul P. complains - I have a computer with a writable DVD drive and a writable CD drive. If I enable writing on one, WinXP turns it off 
for the other.  That can't really be happening, can it?

Disable writing on both and use Nero, Alcohol 120% or similar which support multiple writers.

*** Perhaps you are using an "acceleration" program from your ISP, which, to "speed up" downloads, does not allow you to 
download the entire file [graphic] as posted on the webpage. Rather, it "reformats" the image to a less intense graphic to "simulate" 
a faster download time. 
<P>
ie Smoke and mirrors to make you "believe" your download time is really faster. 
<P>
Malke said:<BR>
Turn off your ISP's acceleration program. Right now you're not downloading the full amount of the pictures' data.
