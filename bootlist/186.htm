installing XP SP2.

<P>
claude76 inquires - Got an Aopen AK77-600GN and it was working fine at last switch on. Now I'm not 
getting any BIOS beeps or boot up. I am getting power to the board as the standby LED is on and the cpu 
fan is running. I've taken the board out of the case and tried it with just the cpu/heatsink/fan, no joy. Tried it
with a single stick of RAM in all the slots, no joy. Power Supply in the case is good as I've checked it with 
a multimeter, as is power out of the power connector. At a bit of a lose now. Can anyone give me any 
more pointers to try?
<P><BR>
*** As an aside, assuming all other parts are good, a motherboard cant send a beep to the speaker 
unless it has a working cpu. In other words, if you put together a system with just the motherboard and cpu 
ie no video and/or no ram you will get beeps assuming the speaker is connected properly and works. If 
you put in a good video card and good ram on a good motherboard but the cpu is bad or missing you 
wont get beeps. I'm not saying your cpu is bad, ie just an comment that it HAS to be good and seated 
correctly to get beeps. 
<P>
Did you have an internal modem installed? Just asking as a surge can toast a modem and then toast the 
motherboard causing the same problem you have. Just a guess. eg you can have perfect cpu and ram 
and video but if the motherboard has been toasted it wont beep even with a good cpu.  The good news
is if in fact a surge came through your modem and also toasted the motherboard chances are the cpu
and ram ARE still good.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Secure FTP Program</font></STRONG>
<P>
"WinSCP is an open source SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and SCP (Secure CoPy) client for 
Windows using SSH (Secure SHell). Its main function is safe copying of files between a local and a 
remote computer."
<P><BR>
*** OK that's that's the author's explanation above.  WinSCP is best described as a [secure FTP] utility.
You will need your webpage host to set up a shell account for you FIRST if you want to use it. Many hosts 
will not do this for you unless you have a good working relationship with them as it's such a powerful 
program.  
<P>
Note that there are a HUGE number of features in this utility and you may find many of them most useful.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Slower Dialup Connection Is Sometimes Better?</font></STRONG>
<P>
ChrisCoaster wrote - I still have primitive dialup, and a little pair of monitors that display the connection 
speed, in the Systray.
<P>
When the speed displayed is 36,000bps, I can surf faster than when it displays 45,000bps.  I also get 
fewer hangups and fewer PAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED at 36k than I do at 45k connection speed.
<P>
There. I've said it. Now somebody go ahead and attempt to prove I am cuckoo.
<P>
Thor explains:<BR>
Actually that is more common than you know and I have dealt with it occasionally on customer systems. 
What it means is that your modem is sometimes negotiating a higher connect speed than it should, in 
order to maintain stable, error free communication with the host. It may be caused by sporadic noise on 
the line.
<P>
For example, at the moment your modem handshakes with the host's modem to negotiate a connection 
speed, the line may be clear of noise, or clearer than normal. Soon afterward line conditions may
deteriorate causing instability, poor throughput, etc. but the modem is stuck on the higher connection 
speed which is too fast for the line quality. 
<P>
A good modem should be able to retrain the connection speed to a lower level in order to stabilize it, but 
as is often the case, this doesn't always happen, and the modem persists in trying to communicate at the 
higher speeds, resulting in very poor connection quality. 
<P>
The solution often is to artificially limit the top connection speed via AT commands placed in the 
advanced modem properties. The problem is that your modem may, or may not support some of these 
commands.  You would need to know the modem manufacturer and then do some research on that make
and model to see if there are any AT commands to limit the connect speed to the level that you require. 
Some only allow you to disable things like V.90, V.92, K56, or X2 protocols, which could put you all the 
way down to 33.6 and lower speeds (often 28.8).
<P><BR>
*** I agree. At home here on my dialup and my USR external 28.8 or 33.6 modems all any PC usually 
gets is a 26.6 connection. The old USR modems are conservative. One can note that if you have the
volume knob turned up and here the multiple handshakes. 
<P>
Then often when I bring a customers computer home to work on it overnight I test their Internet connection
and wala, I get upper 30s or even low 40s. Again tho, it may work for 10 or 30 minutes but then file 
downloads stop [ie downloading drivers I need etc. for that system] or the entire connection goes sour. 
I'm sure it works fine in the customers house so I let it be. 
<P>
I first noticed this when the 56K winmodems were the newest thing. Sure, they'd often connect at a joyous
high speed, but  then there were niggles which were often incorrectly blamed on the ISP.

JTJersey wrote - Bought a Hytek 512MB 266Mhz PC2100 DDR DIMM for a new system that is marked as
Non ECC on the package.  In my parts cabinet I found a PNY 128MB 266Mhz DDR DIMM, however there 
are no other markings on it or the packaging indicating PC2100 or Non ECC.  I'd like to throw both of them
into the system I'm putting together, but I'm concerned about compatibility.  Think they'll play nice 
together?
<P><BR>
*** You will never know unless you try. It's pretty much the same old rule, eg often newer parts just dont
get along with older parts on the same channel [for hard drives] or bank [for ram]. There is no way to test
this in advance, even with hard drives of the same brand but vastly different manufacturing dates. What
may work perfectly in one pc may not work at all in another.  
<P>
I've often mixed ram on many different systems and sometimes it works perfect and other times its error
city in certain applications, namely Explorer or even IE, or even Netscape or your html editor for that 
matter.  Windows Explorer is one of the best free ram compatibility testers out there :)
<P>
If you are doing that system for your friend or client however, I'd  be wary as it may work just fine for the
30 minutes you test it out in your shop or home but may not work fine in the long term with the mixed ram. 
<P>
A single large ram stick is the best, or second best is 2 [sister] sticks bought at the same time. Mixing
brands, types, sizes, ages, is always a hit or miss option.  This is the reason that it's often recommended
that when you buy a new pc you should always spring for the amount of ram you think you'll need 2 or 3 
years down the road. 
<P>
Thor adds:<BR>
Chances are that the PNY module is non-ECC as well (it's the most common type used), or else it would probably be labelled as such. In any case, the modules should work ok in non-ECC mode I would think 
even if one is an ECC module.
