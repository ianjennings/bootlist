<P>
Wolfslayer asks - Is there a way to use a bootdisk to see what's on my XP computer that is done in NTFS
file format? My regular bootdisks dont even say there is a drive present. 
<P><BR>
*** True, a standard dos/win bootdisk wont see NTFS drives without a special driver. There are a few
utils/drivers one can utilize to view, copy data, or even delete and edit files on NTFS drives after a dos
boot. 
<P>
I've assembled Two Methods for you to see and work with NTFS drives while in DOS or by booting with 
a DOS bootdisk or bootable CD. They may come in real handy if you need to save data or modify/add/delete/edit files on an NTFS Drive or Partition.

<P>
Mindy wrote - I have a bootable cd and 2 cdrom drives but it will only boot from one of them. Why?
<P><BR>
*** Sometimes bootable CDs like to be booted from a Master Drive [or should I say, the first CD Drive it 
sees while POSTING] . So, assuming both your drives on on the secondary channel it's probably booting OK 
from the one set as Master in the bios/jumper settings.  If you need to boot from the "non-booting" drive assuming your Master is flaky and you want to boot from the slave just go into your BIOS and set it to 
NONE for the Master. It should then boot just fine from the Slave drive.
<P>
If both your CDrom drives are set to Slave to Hard drives on different channels then in theory, it shouldn't 
matter which drive you put the bootable cd in.  However, the pc may still insist on booting from the first 
cdrom drive it sees.

<P>
Ocean Maiden emailed - 
You have a link for IrfanView on your Bootdisk.com site. Why not add XnView?
<P>
It is also 100% free and is 10x better than IrfanView with more features, a detailed help file, and a user 
support forum. There is also an XnView Deluxe version, which is shareware, but I find the free version to 
be MUCH better, and the free version has more skins than the paid version.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.xnview.com/">http://www.xnview.com/</A>
<P><BR>
*** Thanks.  It works a lot different than Irfanview but I have to say it was lots of fun to try out. I do like a lot
of its features. This is easy to recommend as a program to try out.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Windows Related Duplicate Files</font></STRONG>
<P>
qwerty inquired - I am utilizing System Mechanic 5 Professional by iolo. I have searched for duplicate files
to help free up drive space.  Many windows-related files turn up, each located in 2 different directories. 
Can one or both be deleted?  Is there a general rule of thumb? 
<P><BR>
*** Yes there is a general rule of thumb. Dont mess with dupes that are related to your OS or applications 
that you've installed. Dont mess with dupes that are located in Windows and Program File Folders. 
<P>
Mike H. added:<BR>
You need to be VERY careful when removing duplicate files unless you have created them personally. 
Some files NEED to be in duplicate folders.
<P>
Rock said:<BR>
General rule of thumb, don't mess with it for system files.  Get a larger hard drive.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Internet Worms And Address Books</font></STRONG>
<P>
Iona Bond asked - Do an internet worms find addresses in the address books of all email programs,  or 
are some,  such as Outlook express, more prone to infection?  Wondering if having a less popular email 
client such as The Bat, etc.  would be a better bet.
<P><BR>
*** In the past it was true that using a non-MS email client was MUCH safer to prevent abuse of your 
address book(s), but that option to minimize risk is fading fast. The latest emailing worms/trojans are 
searching your hard drive for email addresses in all types of files. 
<P>
Toolman Tim adds:<BR>
[For example, the] Worm_Sober.U (Related to: Worm_Sober.S)
<P>
This worm uses its own SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) engine to send messages to all email addresses it obtains from files with the following extensions:
