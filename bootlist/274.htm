<STRONG><font color="red">1) My Processor Speed Changes</font></STRONG>
<P>
mclemore1 asked - I've got a Toshiba satellite p35 notebook, pent 4, 3.2g processor and 1.5 gig ram,  well when I go to system properties under general, under computer I'm showing:
<P>
mobile Intel(R)<BR>
Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.2GHz<BR>
1.86GHz  1.5 GB of RAM
<P>
My question is what does the 1.86GHz mean?  Sometimes its 2.4 or even 3.20 Why does this change?  I know its related to the 
processor but I don't know why it changes.  It is a hyper threading processor.  If it stayed at 3.2 I wouldn't be asking.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Temporary Mouse Freeze</font></STRONG>
<P>
Elco inquired - PS/2 mouse sometimes get stuck for 1 or two seconds and then the cursor moves again, mostly to an unexpected 
place since the last movements of the mouse are 'remembered'.
<P>
Also by clicking, to start a program, open another window, the system 'freezes'  for a second but then continues without problem. I tried other mouses, PS/2 and USB ; still the same phenomena.
<P><BR>
*** I'd venture to say that 95% of the time that is due to the last application you have installed or set to run 24/7. For example, I often run
a way old, outdated version of Winfax in the background when I need to receive faxes. Every time I do my mouse does the exact 
same thing. After my faxes are received I disable Winfax and all is back to normal. 
<P>
As far as a fix? That would depend on the specific program causing the hang, which of course, is often spyware.

<P>
I hope that you have been enjoying my publication and will continue to do so.  As you have observed the number of new issues has 
been dropping recently. This is essentially due to my not finding and/or discovering good and/or new material. In fact, some
other popular PC newsletter Authors have even taken a few months off.  
<P>
Yes I could rehash older topics and problems but generally I like to wait at least 6 months before I address a particular problem a
second or third time. And even then, it's generally only if new links/fixes/tweaks are available. While I do enjoy and appreciate the
$5 breakfasts that often come in after every issue I'm not in the habit of sending out bulk mail in hopes of a donation. 
<P>
In summary, yes I am at the helm 24/7 and will continue to look for/discover/publish constructive articles for distribution.  It's quite possible tho that the frequency of issues may not increase until Vista is released. As you well know, at that time I'll have no problem finding good, new material.   
<P>
As an aside, I've been publishing The BootLIST since February 1st, 2002.  Trivia: From 1996 until 2002 it was called The Blackboard
and was only available online at the computer sales/service website I owned.
