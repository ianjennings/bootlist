<P>
Mary A. asks - I heard that Microsoft will be offering several versions of their new operating system called Vista. I only do basic
stuff with my computer. Will there be a slim-lined version released?
<P>
Seems so:<BR>

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Scandisk Shuts Off Win98 PC At 66% Done</font></STRONG>
<P>
Susan G. telephoned - Hi Ed. I am trying to fix a Windows 98 Second Edition Computer that is having strange errors. I know that the 
client just shuts off the Computer with the power switch instead of shutting down correctly so the first thing to do is to run a scandisk
but every time I do it "resets" at 66% and the pc seems to shut down. I cant get past that. Is the hard drive bad? This happens if I run scandisk from a DOS bootdisk or in Windows Safe Mode. Any clues?
<P><BR>
*** Well yes, the hard drive "may" be bad, especially considering it's an older PC. But, do this first. Go into the bios and look at the 
power options. The option for the hard drive may be set at "Maximum". And yes, there may be no "minute" limit to set or adjust. 
On some BIOS's, the maximum [power saving mode] may be for only a minute or two. Set it to NONE, ie no power saving and that should work.

Amrik M. wrote - I have a HP Pavilion purchased in July 2000. Immediately after turning it on, I get a Phoenix BIOS Setup Utility with 5 Menus. Then if I exit it gives a message that says "Operating System Not Found".  The OS is Windows 98.  What do I do?
<P><BR>
*** For starters, replace the cmos battery.  It's at least 6 years old and perhaps up to 8 years old.  On older PCs if the bios loses its settings it goes to default which often sets the hard drive line(s) to NONE.  [As an aside, newer PCs the default is most often AUTO 
so your PC will still bootup even with a bad battery]. So, find  the setting in the BIOS to Find/Detect your hard drive, then hit Save/Exit, 
to at least see if you can bootup.  
<P>
Secondly, another problem may be that that hard drive has failed, or one of the cables connecting to it has become loose. If, while in 
the bios, while selecting "detect hard drive" or similar lingo, it fails to detect the hard drive, then check the cables. If the cables are 
fine then the hard drive has likely gone south. After all, 6 years life for a hard drive is nothing to complain about.

Jack posted - Can 16-bit DOS programs run okay on 64-bit CPUs? I heard about 32-bit would be no problems. Would 16-bit ones be okay too?
<P>
Ken B. responded:<BR>
The issue is with the operating system, not the CPU. If you are running 32-bit Windows XP (even on a 64-bit CPU), yes. you can run 
16-bit applications (at least many of them; some wont run even on a 32-bit CPU).
<P>
However, if you are running 64-bit Windows XP, no, you can't run 16-bit applications.

notnow asked - I am running Win XP and was wondering what would happen if I deleted all the files in the "Prefetch Folder".  What purpose do all the files in this folder serve?
<P>
Senti said:<BR>
XP uses the files in the prefetch folder to help applications start up faster.  If you delete them, the next time you start some programs, 
they'll take a little longer to load, *and* XP will just rebuild the cached files that you deleted.

burn more than 700Mb onto the new CD. Is there an answer, or do I just throw out the new disks.
<P>
Richard U. said:<BR>
Your CD drive "must" have the same capability. You CD burning program "must" have the same capability. If not - you will not get 850 meg on the CD's.
