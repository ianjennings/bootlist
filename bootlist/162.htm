<STRONG><font color="red">1) Add RAM Or Change Graphic Card?</font></STRONG>
<P>
milki1970 asks - I have 256 DDRAM and GeForce 2 (64 MB) on AMD 1700+ XP and Asrock motherboard. 
Some games are choppy. What is the first thing to do? Add more RAM or change graphic card? (I don't 
have enough money for both).
<P><BR>
*** Well the first thing to do [try] is to turn down the number of colors if you have it set very high. The more
colors you have the slower the display. I believe the eye can only see 1.2 million colors but some windows
display card settings can produce much more. Worth a try as you may not need to buy anything. 
<P>
Or of course the PC may be ram challenged. eg If you have XP that takes 128 or so just to boot up. Many
games these days use 120 meg right off the bat so in that case  you're already swapping. If you have a
slow hard drive eg a Quantum 4,800 rpm or even a standard 5,400 rpm drive you can see a big difference
if you go with a more modern 7,200 rpm HDD. 
<P>
Ron M. replies:<BR>
Adding more memory can noticeably improve performance only if the added memory results in reduced 
usage of the virtual memory paging file.  Therefore if the paging file is not currently being used to any
significant extent then adding more memory will not provide a significant improvement.
<P>
With Windows XP there is no convenient way built in to check on actual paging file usage (e.g. no 
Windows XP equivalent of the System Monitor - Swap File In Use report from Windows 95/98/Me).
<P>
A free utility written by MVP Bill James to report on actual paging file usage can be downloaded from:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_pagefilemon.htm">http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_pagefilemon.htm</A><BR>
<A HREF="http://billsway.com/notes_public/WinXP_Tweaks/">http://billsway.com/notes_public/WinXP_Tweaks/</A>
<P>
If that utility shows actual paging file usage of 50 mb or more on a regular basis then that is pretty 
conclusive evidence that adding more RAM will result in improved performance.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Free, ShortURL Subdomain Referral Service</font></STRONG>
<P>
Nice free and ad free subdomain referral service with lots of features:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.shortURL.com/">http://www.shortURL.com/</A>
<P>
So lets say you have a long URL for your website like:<BR>
http://www.internetlinkscompany.com/users/~yourname
<P>
You can now have http://yourname.shorturl.com and if you choose when you sign up to hide your real 
URL so only the http://yourname.shorturl.com will show up in the URL window assuming yourname is not 
already taken. There are other domain names to choose as well like yourname.alturl.com

<STRONG><font color="red">3) A Windows 98 Note</font></STRONG>
<P>
I see lots of windows 98 systems that have lots of problems. Many of these problems could have been
avoided by the following:
<P>
1. Keeping your anti-virus up to date
<P>
2. Running anti-spyware programs
<P>
3. Doing a Thorough Scandisk
<P>
#3 can take hours so most folks dont do it.  Hard drives often do develop bad sectors and if they're not
marked bad much time can be wasted by your PC using those areas to write [try to write] data to resulting
in all kinds of problems. 
<P>
In the long run it's cheaper to do preventive maintenance.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Worm Causing Email Problems</font></STRONG>
<P>
John asks - I am one of those poor souls whose email address is being used by some unknown  
person(s) who are sending messages to people (poorer souls) that contain one sort of virus or another. I receive notifications from time time saying the a message I sent was blocked because it contained a 
virus. Invariably I've never heard of the email address the virus-infected email was addressed to and it's 
certainly not in my addressbook. What can I do about this problem short of changing my email address?
<P>
Mike says:<BR>
Your email address is NOT being used by an unknown person, it is being spoofed by one of the many 
internet worms that do this.  Either you, someone in your address book, or somebody who has you in 
their address book is, or has been, infected with one of these viruses. The worms collect addresses, and 
send out to random addresses based on the information they collect. 
<P>
Short of changing your email address, I recommend Magic Mail Monitor; you can view what is on the
server and delete it before ever having to download anything.
<P>

*** Before you change your email address sometimes it's just best to wait it out until the infected PC (s)
eventually get cleaned one way or another.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Need XP To Open Folders In Detail Mode</font></STRONG>
<P>
Rich posts - How do I change the default setting so whenever I open any folder it opens in detail mode?  
<P>
April suggests:<BR>
When in explorer<BR>
Set the view to details, or however you want it to look<BR>
Go to tools | folder options<BR>
Hit view button<BR>
Hit  Apply to all folders<BR>
Hit yes on the prompt<BR>
Close all explorer windows<BR>
Relaunch, all folder views should be set to details or whatever view [you] chose at the beginning
<P>
Phil adds:<BR>
XP only remembers 400 folder views by default. To have it remember more:
<P>
First download and install the fix to make xp remember more than 8000 folders. Column 1, #2
