<STRONG><font color="red">1) CDrom Drives Seen, But Not Working</font></STRONG>
<P>
Lando C. wrote -  I am having problems with my cd-rom drive and dvd drive. I can see both drive in my windows explorer. But when I insert a cd-rom I can not read it. I removed the cd-rom drive and dvd -drive from the device manager.  After restarting Windows XP it automatically detected both drives. But still I cannot read cd and dvd. I looked also in the BIOS, both drives are mentioned in the bios.
<P><BR>
*** Some things to check:
<P>
1. A drive or both drives may not work on the same channel if the other drive on the same channel is bad.<BR>
2. Could be a jumper setting problem if you've recently installed a drive incorrectly. eg if you add a Slave drive to a channel and set 
the Jumper to Slave you also may have to change the original drive jumper to Master.<BR>
3. An IDE cable may be bad and/or shorting out on a sharp edge of the innards of the case.<BR>
4. An IDE cable may have become partially mis-seated from the motherboard or drive.<BR> 
5. You may have a boot sector virus.<BR>
6. Boot do DOS with a bootdisk that sees cdrom drives and see if you can read a disk. This will tell you if it's a Windows problem or a hardware problem. Note that just doing a Dir command will only read the FAT so you also have to see if one can open Edit or a text 
file, etc. after a dos boot.<BR>
7. Worst case is that the channel the CDrom drives are on is not working correctly or is bad, tho very rare especially since XP is detecting the drives. 
<P>
The above list is not at all complete for cdrom drive problems. However, the first step is seeing if your problem is hardware or
software based. That's one good reason bootdisks and bootable CDs that take you to DOS are still very valuable as they dont
care what OS you have installed. If it doesn't work in DOS, then it wont work in Windows. And if it doesn't work in DOS, then  you
have a hardware problem, not a Windows problem.

<P>
DaveF inquired - I decided to transfer some important files from my active 160 gig C drive to my old C drive, which is now drive E,  a 
20 gig unit as a form of backup. I filled up E drive except for 64 Kb.  Now XP sends me an annoying "Low Disk Space" warning about drive E about once a minute.  But I don't care that there is low space.  Does anyone know how to turn off the warning?

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Phishing Email - New Niggle</font></STRONG>
<P>
LorrainG. telephoned - In the past it was easy to ID false emails from banks or online vendors. Now it seems they are sending in
plain text, and most important, are including your real name in the body of the email. If you are tired and stressed out it's become
quite easy to get fooled even for an above average IQ person.  
<P><BR>
*** Quite true. eg the latest phishing emails from "paypal"  are addressed to your real name in the body of the email, and simply
want to to verify your credit card information. The same is happening for banks and such. Still. Keep with the #1 RULE - NEVER click
on a link on such type emails. ALWAYS log onto the site by first MANUALLY typing in the URL.
