<STRONG><font color="red">1) StartUp Utility</font></STRONG>
<P>
MrZorg asked - Is there a good startup utility that you can recommend? 
<P>
There are several. Note that the best way to disable a startup is to use the program itself. After that of
course you have msconfig built into windows. Some third party utilities are below. Autoruns is the most
modern.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) How I Auto Backup Data Over My Home Network</font></STRONG>
<P>
Smith called - I have a few pcs in my home connected to a router and my network is set up and runs. I
was wondering if you could recommend a file backup program that works over the network and can
do both mirroring folders and entire hard drives to other computers in my network. 
<P><BR>
*** There are a few of them, but the one I'm sold on and have running 24/7 is Second Copy 2000 from:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.centered.com/">http://www.centered.com/</A>
<P>
Mind you, I tried it as shareware, then registered it, and the Author has no idea who I am or that I'm even
mentioning it here. Here's why I like it:
<P>
I have a second, pre done bootable hard drive in my wife's pc that I set Second Copy set to mirror my 
entire hard drive to once/week. I have a second hard drive in my son's pc that I have it set to mirror my 
most important folders every 3 hours.  Yes I still backup important folders to cd regularly but  you know 
how that is, you forget to do it, run out of media, or just plain put it off :)
<P>
It's a really productive way to utilize older drives as most often the other pcs in your home have room for 
them. You can set Performance - Background Copy Priority to [Low] and you wont even notice its working.
<P>
I also select Exact Copy - which deletes files on the destination [Drive or Folder] you deleted and/or 
cleaned up on the Source Folder or Drive. No need to keep a backup of useless temp or Intenet cache
files after a cleaning on the Source PC.  
<P>
Once you get used to the program and reading the Log you wont be concerned about the copy Errors as 
they are simply files in use that you dont need copied anyway. One can even set Second Copy to [Hide 
icon from system tray] if you dont want to see the E in the tray.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) XP Lost My Sound Card</font></STRONG>
<P>
John T. posted - Recently my soundblaster audigy2 just stopped working.  I checked in device manager, 
and it wasn't even listed in there, and the add hardware wizard couldn't find it.  I tried reinstalling the drivers
from the creative disk, but they wouldn't install since the card wasn't detected.
<P>
I haven't made any configuration changes to this machine for about 2 weeks prior to this happening, so 
this doesn't appear to be the problem.
<P>
Anyone know how I can get this card working again?
<P><BR>
*** A common niggle. Assuming your sound card is good the standard operating procedure for that type
of problem is to boot to Safe Mode and REMOVE ALL instances of sound in device manager. On the
reboot XP should find your card and then you install the drivers according to the docs. ie sometimes
the docs say to cancel the OS's attempt to install drivers and then run the install from the sound card
CD. Sometimes you can just point XP to the drivers folder on the creative or other brand drivers cd. 
<P>
And of course sometimes XP will just install the drivers automagically using it's own drivers or using
the drivers you originally installed. 
<P>
It the above fails then sometimes you have to pull the card and put it in another slot on the motherboard to
force XP to find it fresh. Sound cards used more resources than any other card so its a good habit
to have it first in the lineup ie the next one down from the AGP video card but skip a pci slot. After ten years
of building PCs this setup has always worked for me:
<P>
AGP video card<BR>
Empty PCI slot<BR>
Sound card<BR>
NIC<BR>
Modem
<P>
Yes I know integrated motherboards [eg video, sound, NIC onboard] are very popular now so the above
is not an issue but you may still encounter the "lost sound card" problem on such boards as well. 
<P>
As an aside, if you're building your own PC check the bios for an item that says: Plug and Play OS 
[YES or NO] as by default many motherboards come default as NO and you have to change it to Yes
for best results when installing windows.  Also, check the serial [com] port settings. If you are not going to 
be using them Disable them in the bios to free up more resources for the cards and devices you are 
going to be using.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Email Reply Verification Service</font></STRONG>
<P>
Jet57 asked - I get lots of spam so I am considering using an email verification service. It is the type of
service that asks the sender to supply more information in order to send mail to me or to reply to me. 
It it worth the hassle I figured I would ask you as you perhaps see lots of that type of thing? 
<P><BR>
*** It may be worth the hassle for you and your family and friends to communicate and reduce spam to
your private addresses. By private I mean you only use a particular email address for friends and 
family. By private I mean an email address that you NEVER use on webpages, for newsletters, for writing
to folks you dont know, etc. 
<P>
For business and general use however, I STRONGLY suggest NOT to subscribe to such a service. 
<P>
Why? Take for example you are asking for email tech support for that new printer. The helpdesk person 
is NOT going to bother jumping through additional hoops to help you as many of those verification 
services just take you to a webpage where you have to fill out a form, have put in the first and last name EXACTLY as it appears in your mail setup and who remembers that off the bat, and read those hard to 
read graphics and enter in those characters, etc. 
<P>
Or how about registering for a PIN, some new software, or just signing up for a service. This is mostly 
handled by BOTS and the BOT cant answer questions or fill in forms which in these cases you've just 
added hours of hassle and time trying to get what you need and/or paid for as you'll never see the 
response. 
<P>
Or how about this example that happened to me the other day.  The service required me to fill in a first 
and last name or the form wouldn't work. I have only one name in my email and it has a period in the 
middle. The form wouldn't allow it and I'm not going to change my email setup just to reply to a single 
person.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Do I Need To Reboot My Explorer?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Pete wrote - I have a Ford Explorer that runs great but the other day while going to work the Check Engine
light came on and it's been on for weeks now. My truck runs the same as always and I dont have the
money now to take it to the repair shop.
<P>
I heard that sometimes all you need to do is reboot the computer to make the light go away if so how do
you do that?
<P><BR>
*** The check engine light may or may not indicate a problem or a potential problem. For example, on
some vehicles it may go on if a sensor goes bad or there is a problem with the pollution control among
many other reasons. That may or may not affect performance. 
<P>
Sometimes tho it's just an error ie some code stuck in ram.  It's common for auto repair shops to simply
disconnect the car's computer, wait a bit, and plug it back in and see if the Check Engine light goes
away. Personally tho, I find it's easier to just remove the Negative Battery terminal overnight and connect
it back in the morning as you can shed some skin pulling out the computer connector.  
<P>
If in the morning the light is off, then all you needed was the reboot. If it's still on, then I'd consider having
it checked out once you have the funds.  Note that the Check Engine light may indicate a bad airbag
sensor in the bumper and since you generally need two of them to pop a bag in case of an accident
that's surely a good reason to take the indicator Light seriously. 
<P>
As an aside, certain auto makers used to, [I have no idea if they still do], have it built in where that light 
goes on every 15,000 miles like my parents old Volkswagon Rabbit did in the late 70s. In the Rabbit there 
was a secret button you pushed under the hood on the pc to reboot it and the light would go off.  The 
manual, however, said to take it to the dealer :)
