<P>
Midwest posts - I am trying to upgrade the memory in my computer.  I have 2 computers, both running XP.  
On both I find it quite strange that with a 256 memory stick it only reads half.  Therefore, with using 2, 256s 
which should enable me to have 512, I am now only at 256.  This is also the case on another computer.  I 
find it strange that 3 memory sticks would  be bad.
<P>
Ron M. replies:<BR>
You probably are using (or trying to use) high density single sided PC133 SDRAM modules in an older motherboard that supports PC133 but requires the older low density (double sided) design.
<P>
Double sided PC133 modules are still available but are a bit harder to find (may have to be special 
ordered) and cost approximately double the price of the more popular high density modules.
<P><BR>
*** They are probably not bad, but just not fully compatible with your motherboard(s). Or, perhaps, your motherboard can only handle 128/slot, which would be rather odd if your motherboard was newer. 
<P>
I have 3 PCs here at home about the same age and I've run into that also. ie it worked on one, but not the 
other two. Go figure!  I fixed my problem by using older, used ram. Seems my older motherboards just
didn't like the brand new ram. 
<P>
ps Just for clarification if you're not used to the jargon, a single sided ram board has the actual memory
chips on just one side of the board, while a double sided, well, you get the point.  This is just a pure
coincidence but one of the best places to get ram for older PCs is actually located in my home town:
<P>
Coast To Coast Memory aka 18004memory.com<BR>

<P>
The best thing to do is to call them as you may find their selection overwhelming and hard to choose from
unless your somewhat of a ram geek. If you want to sell your old ram they can also be trusted.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Problems With InCD On XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
CW asks - Greetings, I copied some files to burn onto a CD, and now cannot delete those files from the 
CD or from the InCD memory. When I try, I get a msg that the file is in use by someone else. Whenever I 
put another blank CD into my drive, the original list of files I copied show up, saying Ready to be written 
to CD.
<P>
How can I delete these copies so that I can burn a brand new CD, and not have these ghost files always showing up?. 
<P>
Alex N. replies:<BR>
You have installed InCD as a 'packet writing' facility for CD-RW, but left the inbuilt CD burning still on.  The 
two methods do not mix.  In My Computer, right click the drive, Properties, Recording page uncheck
'Enable Recording' - this controls the inbuilt system, and has no effect on INCD.  Then for batch burning 
of sessions use Nero.
<P><BR>
*** It's often suggested that when you use a third party CD burning program that you turn off the XP burning
software. This is because it's always running when you bootup and may, and often does, interfere with the
new burning application(s) you have installed.

Denver writes - I am using XP home edition and have a problem with hotbar popups. I cannot find the 
program that generates the (hotbar)program functions to eliminate it.  I have sent EMails twice requesting 
they be stopped and they ignore the requests.

<P>
Anopheles wrote - I have not been able to download jpegs recently, only as bmps. I'm told this is 
because my cache is full. If so, how do I empty the cache.
<P>
Alex N. answers:<BR>
Control Panel - Internet Options, and in the middle of the General page, Temporary Internet files, click 
Delete files (do not usually delete Offline ones).  While there I suggest clicking Settings next to it, and
setting the space allowed down to something under 100MB - 50 should be plenty.  That will stop it 
overloading the indexes again.
