Grog emailed - Hi my friend my teenage daughter is going to college in a week and she has to make due
in a 3 person dorm room with no real room if you get my meaning. So using my acquired by experience 
pc building skills I built her a small computer to save space.  Here is the bare bones unit that I selected to 
build from: 
<P>
<A HREF="http://usa.asus.com/products/desktop/terminator-a7vt/overview.htm">http://usa.asus.com/products/desktop/terminator-a7vt/overview.htm</A>
<P>
It was easier than I thought to construct all I did was add the cpu, ram, her old hard drive and cdrom burner. 
The drivers that came with the unit worked perfectly. This is a lot smaller then the mid-tower she used to
have at home. My question is are there any things to watch out for in case I have to fix it later on?
<P><BR>
*** While it looks just like a small tower in the photo I'm familiar with that design and it's actually about 
75% of the size of a standard small tower pc.  Other folks are even going with the CUBE format, which is 
about half _that_ size.  Here's what to think about in the case you have to fix it later on. 
<P>
Power supply.  It's likely NOT to have even a the new standard mini-ATX PS. Chances are it's an extreme
proprietary design. Many of these small unit's PS's dont have built in fan. They often depend on the 
larger case fan to do BOTH the case and PS cooling. 
<P>
Many colleges have geek squads that can fix many pc problems, even hardware. However, they wont
have the Power Supply nor the Case Fan for that unit. The case fan for that type of unit and also many
cube designs is NOT the standard 80mm/3.1" that you can find at most any pc store. It's often larger as it
has to do two jobs.  And forget about finding a power supply for that unit in a local pc store or even in most
pc repair shops. 
<P>
Case fans rarely fail but they can slow down and get noisy. Power supplies can fail anytime and often do
if the unit gets hit by a surge. If you are going to be supporting that unit then spend the time in advance to 
find and/or locate the replacement parts that you may need in the future, even going so far as to keep a 
spare fan and power supply for your daughter's pc in stock and ready to go.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Can't Install SP2 On Flea Market Computer</font></STRONG>
<P>
Conrad H. asked - My flea market computer evidently has a bogus copy of XP pro on it so SP2 says it 
doesn't like the key.  If I go buy a new copy can I install over the old and fix the problem?  I have lots of 
other stuff on the machine [I've installed over time] and can't imagine starting over.  Can someone 
suggest what coarse of action to take?
<P>
Nutcase suggests:<BR>
Yes, a real copy of WinXP Pro can be used to do a repair installation of the bogus installation and 
preserve your user profiles, software, settings, and data. What you will need to do is a repair installation 
using the legitimate key. Follow these steps:
<P>
1. Insert the Windows XP CD into your computer's CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive.<BR>
2. Restart your computer. If you have to, change the BIOS settings to start from the CD-ROM drive or 
DVD-ROM drive, and then restart your computer again.<BR>
3. At the "Welcome to Setup" page, press ENTER (not "r" to repair).<BR>
4. Press F8 to accept the Licensing Agreement.<BR>
5. Use the arrow keys to select the installation of Windows XP that you want to repair, and then press R to 
start the automatic repair process.<BR>
6. When Setup is completed, activate Windows XP.
<P>
I strongly suggest that you physically disconnect the system from the internet until you are absolutely 
sure that the firewall is up and running, as the fresh install will be very susceptible to all the viruses still out 
there actively seeking unprotected machines.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Third Party Program Uninstallers</font></STRONG>
<P>
Jamie wrote - I would like to ask if it is safe to use certain third party software that helps with uninstalling software. For example http://www.martau.com/ offers a recommended program that helps you 
"uninstall" programs.
<P>
I am quite often trying 5 or 10 different small programs before I decide which one to use which then 
involves a lot of uninstalling, I understand of course that this can leave unwanted traces of the program 
behind even after the programs uninstaller has been used.
<P>
So my question is: What is your advice with regard to this situation? Is it better to use a good third party 
software (this one is recommended by pricelessware) or is it perfectly ok to use the [built-in] uninstallers 
and not bother with this kind of software.
<P><BR>
*** I also test lots of new software, but, as the utility hound/tester that I am I still wouldn't even consider 
using such programs. In order for them to work they have to be installed first and running in advance of 
installing new software so that they can keep track of the changes made to your system. 
<P>
And as noted in the first screen on most installs it says to disable your backgrounds apps. before 
proceeding. A third party uninstaller would count as a _major_ background app.
<P>
I'd stick with the uninstallers that come with the apps you choose which of course, windows add/remove
just points to when you need it. 
<P>
Bill J. adds:
<P>
That type of 3rd party uninstaller works by tracking changes made when a program is installed, then 
attempting to reverse all such changes [when you run their uninstall].  There are a lot of things that can go 
wrong still if the application has any logic errors, and I'm not sure it is really worth the trouble.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) What Is A Low Level Format?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Carl G posted - What is a low level format and how does it differ from regular formatting a hard drive.
<P><BR>
*** Your hard drive will NOT let you LLF it. However, many utils, including some ones from hard drive 
makers _improperly_ call their zero fill utils LLF [Low Level Format] utilities. 
<P>
ie YOU cant LLF format a modern drive. YOU can, however, zero fill it and bring it back to a factory fresh 
state. In this case all data is overwritten with zeros or ones. 
<P>
Mark D. says: A Low level Format (physical format) creates the tracks and sectors on a Hard Disk. It is 
done at the factory.
<P>
You cannot do this on newer drives from your PC. Older MFM drives can be Low level formatted from 
your PC. 
<P>
High level format (the format command in dos and windows) is a logical formatting that creates the data structures for the disk.
