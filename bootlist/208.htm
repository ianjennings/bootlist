Kevin posted - Since going on virgin broadband I cannot seem to view some images on some web 
pages they either say where the picture should be THE PAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED or there is a 
small vertical rectangle white box with a red x that appears instead.  Why is this?

*** Thus far I've always avoided initiating such a problem when helping folks go to broadband. But again, 
I NEVER use the CD that most often comes with the broadband account UNLESS the broadband supplier
specifically requires it.  Just like dialup, dont use their CDs unless it's 100% REQUIRED.   
<P>
On a related note, the same applies to new printers. You may get 3 cds and even with just the "basic"
drivers CD you may have the option to add new fonts, new software, etc. ALWAYS just choose the
driver install only to start off with.  You can add the other functions later if you want to experiment.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Is 15% Free Space Really Needed?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Kane's son asked - XP Home SP1 defrag gave message that to successfully complete this operation
15 percent freespace [on the hard drive] was needed and I had only 7 percent. The drive is large and 7 
percent translates to 7.5 GB free, is this really not enough to run defrag successfully? 
<P><BR>
*** Obviously not. Interestingly, when XP was first sold MS recommended at least 2 gig free on your hard
drive at all times. Times sure have changed as hard drive sizes increased. I'd agree with the 15% 
recommendation without hesitation. Think about it, during a defrag files have to be moved around the 
drive temporarily and file sizes have also increased exponentially. 
<P>
In other words Kane has a 100 gig HDD so he should keep at least 15% free space at all times.  Now
let's go a bit further. Suppose you are fixing a pc for a buddy/customer that's having odd niggles and
you see his/her 100 gig HDD is almost full so you remove temps, Internet cache, apps. no longer used,
etc. and when you're done you have 15% free space. What's going to happen when you leave? 
<P>
System restore points will start to pile up, so will the Internet cache files and of course the new software
the friend/customer will no doubt install within hours now that he/she has all this "free available disk 
space".   The real fix for this example is to STRONGLY recommend a larger hard drive.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Slow Right Click Menu Repair Tool</font></STRONG>
<P>
The slow right click menu problem is somewhat common. It's caused by third party software that is not
yet perfected for XP or newer versions of XP aka Service Packs.  A tool is available to tweak this problem
which includes a nice readme which explains its function in good detail. JClark's post may help describe 
the problem and a neat way to address it. 
<P>
JClark posted -

I had just put together a new system with some fairly old parts and an OEM windows XP OS. After 
installing a number of my favorite programs, I noted suddenly that the right mouse click for context in 
Windows Explorer led to a perpetual hourglass, requiring reboot, or multiple efforts at logging off. I had 
trouble even copying the shellexview file because right click didn't work, and neither did highlighting the
file with left click and using "edit" because clicking "edit" locked up the box as well. 
<P>
So I just ran shellexview from a USB memory device, having downloaded it from another functioning 
(W2K) computer.

The overview of the shell context handler problem is here:
<P>
<A HREF="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm</A>
<P>
What shellexview does is to list all the registry entries which have to do with the context menu shell 
handlers. You can disable them ...they say "one at a time" and see what effect it has on the problem.
I did it a lot quicker by bisecting the list, disabling half of the entries in one fell swoop, rebooting and trying 
the right click on a desktop shortcut.
<P>
It worked, so I knew I just had to narrow it down...just as we used to do with msconfig. Then I kept bisecting 
the list until it was just a few and did those one at a time. The problem is that you have to reboot between 
tries to get accurate testing of the results of your disabling. I didn't find logging off to be consistent.
<P>
My problem shell context handler turned out to be "eraser"...I installed an older version which may not 
have been OK for XP.
