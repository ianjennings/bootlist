<STRONG><font color="red">1) Firefox Feedback</font></STRONG>
<P>
Last issue I talked about Firefox, and said "I was, in this article, looking forward to elaborating on several very noteworthy reasons 
why one should design for "all" the most popular browsers......":

Well, a reader named DCS wrote me and pointed out one of the very important reasons why "One should design for all the most 
popular browsers". His comments are as follows, and very important.
<P>
"Consider this: If just one person could not easily access a web site, and that person was a potential customer who was looking for something to buy, and left and never returned - you have lost at least one sale or perhaps a lifelong buyer.  Depending on what you 
sell, this may represent hundreds or thousands of dollars in lost revenue."  
<P>
"In addition to this, you have lost the potential referrals that person may have directed to your web site who may have also spent lots 
of bucks.  The interesting thing, and the reason most website developers dismiss this accessibility problem, is because they don't 
have any way to measure this category of lost revenue, therefore the importance of it is never registered in their minds," wrote DCS.

Kenny asked - [What is the] best RMVB to MPEG converter? [I've tried] loads of these about but which is the best.  Tried DVD Santa 
to convert and burn an RMVB movie but disc wouldn't play.

gords inquired - I've got a machine here that takes forever to shut down. It used to work properly and shutdown smoothly and quickly,
but now it's take about 5 minutes to shut down.

<P>
WEBGURL questioned - Every time I start-up, XP wants to install my printer drivers even though they are already installed from within XP. I have looked at msconfig and it is not loading there. Where else should I look to stop this from occurring.
<P><BR>
*** Often all you have to do is point windows to your drivers disk and let it install it again.

<P>
Sometimes it's the easy things that "get ya". 
<P>
Recently, I was having problems getting my FTP program to remember settings like default file locations, etc. I figured it was just some
corrupt file and next time when I redid my system id'd be fixed. Finally, I had enough, and for the time being started looking for 
another free ftp program. What a hassle. The half a dozen "free" ones I tested had ads, pop unders, etc. 
<P>
So I go look at the settings file, a text file, for my ftp and found it was "read only". I totally forgot that 6 months ago I had restored this folder from a cdrom backup and of course, since it was read only, it wouldn't save any settings. Easy fix eh? 
<P>
In closing, I figured if you needed or wanted a free for home, personal use ftp program you may try my favorite. Simple, no frills. I dont believe the Author offers it anymore for free on his webpage:

<STRONG><font color="red">8) Zip Your Files Prior To Sending</font></STRONG>
<P>
Below is an email I sent to my website host. 
<P>
I noticed when I logged onto cpanel I see this message:
<P>
"Attention:  Be aware that our mail system will prohibit any executable file from being sent. Please "zip" these files prior to sending."
<P>
I am in the process of possibly doing an article on such in bootlist as people are complaining that they are having problems sending 
files via email.
<P>
Questions.
<P>
1. Does your anti-executable thing work for both web email access AND POP
access?
<P>
2. Why do you impose this restriction?
<P>
Randy O. responded:<BR>
I have bootdisk on a server that is strictly for semi dedicated user accounts. The message about exe's pretty much is sent to all 
'Shared" account holders. The restriction is not just us, if you try to send any  .com, .exe, bat, or any of the other executables, MOST email programs will stop it on the spot. This is built in to the mail software and actually requires "disabling" rather than "enabling".
<P>
Sounds sort of funny but my dedicated accounts are run by "real admins" and they are fully aware of the restrictions and their users 
never see cpanel as they do not have the rights to access it.
<P>
This is all done in an effort to curb virus activity and hidden macros.  As today a virus or worm can be injected into your system 
without you even opening the infected mail, preventative measure must occur prior to the user even seeing the mail.  A hassle yes 
but necessary for users protection.
<P>
Even if you could get it past our server,  you would get knocked down along the line by someone elses server software.
