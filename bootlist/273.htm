<P>
Raivo inquired - I've two machines - laptop and PC, both with Windows XP SP2. Neither of them is capable of finishing defrag.
<P><BR>
*** Most likely it's one or more of the apps. that you have running 24/7 that is preventing defrag from working properly. Try safe mode 
or disable those apps. first.

seoulguy posted - Would like to know if anyone has experienced issues with accessing and/or inputting data to secure sites (e.g., 
banking sites) after installing SP2 and, if so, what type of problems were encountered and how solved.

<P><BR>
***
In general, a beeping PC trying to POST is almost always a mis-seated video card or mis-seated ram or ram that has gone bad. The good news is its almost never a processor problem as the processor has to be working in order to give you beeps. If you've 
noticed on modern motherboards the AGP card slot has a lock on it to keep the card in place.  When you look at an AGP video card 
and compare it to a PCI video card you will see how close the contacts are on the AGP compared to the PCI. 
<P>
A bad video card may also result in beeps at POST.  Or, heat may have killed your video card so check if the fan, if any, on the video
card is still working.  Of course one may use google and find a million pages that deal with beep codes but they mostly all are clones
of each other and most of the code descriptions wont help you.

Kiwichick questioned - Suddenly my laptop has lost all its red colors when I connect it to an external monitor.  Everything is in yellow 
and blue. I haven't installed anything else or changed any settings recently.  How do I fix this, or is it a more serious problem?
<P><BR>
*** 
If your laptop displays correctly when NOT using an external monitor than at least you know it's not a video "card" or driver problem.
<P>
My guess is, assuming that the laptop has no problem with it's built in LCD monitor, is that a pin is bent on the external monitor 
cable. One can buy/use a small needle-nose plyer to bend the pin back in place but note that this can be done generally only once
or the pin may break. 
<P>
Many techs/geeks use a monitor extension cable on expensive/shop monitors so if a pin gets bent/breaks the only loss is the cable 
as "built-in" monitor cables can be very difficult/expensive/dangerous to replace if a pin gets bent or breaks off.
