<STRONG><font color="red">1) The Reality Regarding April 12th</font></STRONG>
<P>
Boxer asked - What's the deal with MS and future updates after April 12th? I keep hearing different stories.
Can I get updates after April 12th if I dont have SP2 installed?
<P>
Carey F. explains:<BR>
Only those who do NOT have SP1 or SP2 installed will NOT be able to receive future Updates.  Although
SP2 will be offered as a critical update, it will not be automatically downloaded nor installed until you 
accept the SP2 End-User License Agreement presented to you.
<P>
If you wish, your can order a free SP2 CD:<BR>

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Blurry JPGs. Is It The DPI Or Other?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Ben Rum inquired - I am seeing JPEG's appear blurry, as if not fully downloaded, in some places on my 
PC.  Mainly Internet Explorer. Even the "Start", "Shutdown" and "Stand By" buttons appear this way.
However, if I save a website JPEG locally, and view it in Windows Picture & Fax Viewer it appears 
normal. Is there some OS setting that does this?
<P>
The PC is a Dell laptop (Latitude D505) and I'm not sure if its an WinXP setting or PC Setting.
<P>
Vanguard answers:<BR>
Does the image look clearer when you hit the Refresh toolbar button?  If so, that is probably the wonderful accelerator program you got from your ISP.  It downloads only half of the picture's pixels to give you a 
faster download of the page but a fuzzier one.  Great idea, huh, to lie to their customers that they are 
getting an accelerated connection rate (and might even charge for it) but really are only delivering a 
partial version of each image?  Heck, you could speed you connection up even more if you blocked 
images completely so as not to waste any bandwidth and time to download them.
<P>
If the above isn't your problem, check the DPI setting for your screen. Right-click on desktop and select Properties, or run the Display applet from Control Panel, Settings panel, Advanced button, General tab, 
set the DPI (96 is the default, I believe).
<P>
The specs for LCD screens usually list a "native" resolution (i.e., the resolution at which the screen has 
the correct number of pixels without having to use interpolation to emulate other resolutions).  See if 
switching to the native resolution clears up your screen.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) QuickTime Alternative To Apple</font></STRONG>
<P>
Robert B. noted - I would like to get QuickTime for Win2000, BUT:
<P>
1) The latest version, at least on the Apple site, includes iTunes which I DO NOT want, period.<BR>
2) That same file is umpteen megabytes and would take a number of days to download via POTS - not 
exactly conducive to reliability of results, not to speak of the non-useability of the computer during that 
time.
<P>
So, is there a version of QuickTime that does NOT have iTunes, is fairly recent, runs on the Windows 
2000 platform, and easily obtainable?
<P>
bambam suggests:<BR>
How about this instead-
<P>
QuickTime Alternative (Freeware)<BR>
Windows OS: Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP<BR>
Languages: English<BR>
<P>
Description: QuickTime Alternative will allow you to play QuickTime files (.mov, .qt and other extensions) without having to install QuickTime Player from Apple. It also supports QuickTime content that is 
embedded in webpages. The very user-friendly installation is fully customizable, which means that you 
can install only those components that you want. It is highly recommended to uninstall all existing 
QuickTime related software, like QuickTime Player, before installing. This way your system stays clean 
and potential problems will be avoided.

<P>
benji questioned - I have a video clip I'm trying to send to a friend of mine, but the clip is 12MB big. He 
said to go ahead and send it to his GMail account however when I try, my SMTP server says that the file attachment local size is too big to send.
<P>
We've tried to get it over using MSN Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger but it's still having problems 
sending.  [I dont have a webpage or hosting service BTW].

<P>
Paula H. asks - We have windows XP and for some reason [we] have microsoft works on it which 
includes spreadsheets etc but when someone sends us an email and they have used [MS Excel which
produces] xls [files] we cannot open [them] do you have a quick solution for this?
<P><BR>
*** One can use a free Excel File viewer from MS:<BR>

<P>
Dennis T. adds:<BR>
Just to add a bit here.
<P>
This Excel Viewer will allow you to look at xls files, but you wont be able to do anything with them. To manipulate the files you will need to purchase MS Office or download (free) Open Office 2:
 <P>
<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/">http://www.openoffice.org/</A>
<P>
I have MS Office at work & use Open Office at home to work with the same files I use at work.
<P>
WARNING: Open Office is a HUGE download (85 MB if I recall).  So if you are on dialup be prepared to download for several hours.
<P>

Or get it on CD from a place like cheapbytes.com for ten bucks or less [plus postage].
