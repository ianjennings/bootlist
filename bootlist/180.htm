<P>
Schindler asks - My Windows 98 Second Edition takes a long time to shut down. Is there any utility that
will help?
<P><BR>
*** ShutZ has been my favorite for SE here at home for a long time. Make sure you have all your apps 
closed down first if you dont want to lose data like open email messages or open word files, etc. In other 
words, it doesn't care what's opened so if you dont care and want to shut down fast anyway try it.  
Personally, I wouldn't put this on anybodies PC but your own. 
<P>
It also has a super quick restart option. It sits in the tray. One mouse click either way whilst on top of it gets
you going. As far as I can tell it does close down windows os files properly but just simply snaps off non
os apps. I've never had scandisk pop up after using it like you do if you _improperly_ shut down.

<P>
Mr. Dunham inquires - I still use Win98se and I heard about a program that I can get rid of the arrows on
the desktop shortcuts. I think those arrows are just in the way of a good looking desktop. Any help?
<P><BR>
*** Try TweakUI from Microsoft. Download, unpack to a empty folder, then right mouse click on the .inf file
to install it. Then go to Control Panel to run it. You'll see the arrow options in the Explorer tab. Try the 
light arrows first. If you dont like that look then go select no arrows.  I also like TweakUIs auto log on 
feature.

Lerman wrote - My husband wants XP but both our windows 98 computers work just fine for what my 
family needs to do. I have a couple of Pentium 400+ computers with lots of ram. I recycle my old hard 
drives so I have two hard drives in each computer. Both hard drives are on the same channel, one 
master and one slave. I heard that I could speed up my computers by putting the swap file on the Slave 
drive but my husband says that will only work if the second hard drive was on the Secondary IDE channel.
Is this true?
<P><BR>
*** Used to be true for really old 486 type systems. But for your systems YES, putting the swap file on the 
secondary physical drive WILL speed up your systems even if you have lots of RAM.  Dont worry about
setting the minimum/max either.  It will automatically set the minimum to Zero and the Max to the full size of
your secondary hard drive. 
<P>
To change the swap file settings on a winSE pc, right click on My Computer | Left Click Properties | Left
click Performance | Left Click Virtual Memory. After you're done and reopen the window, you'll see the
options you chose in grey with a checkmark still in [Let windows manage]. Dont worry about that your
settings are being used. You can verify this by looking at your D: drive where you'll see the win386.swp
file in Root.

Kay wrote - I've been using a Natural Microsoft keyboard for 7 years and it finally died some keys just
kept sticking. Unlike other people I know I nor my family have never had any problems with carpel tunnel
problems so I want to stick with a Natural Keyboard. I found at my office supply store the newest version
of the Microsoft keyboard for $49 is this worth it as some others like the Logitech USB ones are half the 
cost.  The MS Natural Keyboard is also PS/2 which I prefer. 
<P><BR>
*** In my day job I get to use/test out just about everything. The new MS Natural keyboards are the best
and sturdiest of all the naturals.  It's worth the extra money in my opinion.  Yes there are some other brands
of naturals some of them also have several usb ports on the back. Keep in mind that those extra ports are
_unpowered_ as compared to a powered usb hub so some devices may not work with it. PS I also prefer
and recommend using a standard PS/2 keyboard over USB. 
<P>
Keep in mind that power has to be OFF when removing or plugging in PS/2 hardware ie mice and
keyboards.

Perry writes - I am a teacher in rural  town Afghanistan and I just acquired seven old networked Packard 
Bell Windows For Workgroups computers so I can start up a computer classroom. Many of my students 
dont even have good electricity power in their houses or  computers. I managed to get the old network 
on by reconnecting the old cables so I can share the HP2 laser jet printer machines to work for the 
children can type their homework.  My friend said I can use MS-DOS to edit some files to help the 
computers run better but I do not know what he means.
<P>
All the computers have Compact Disk Drives and Floppy Drives and are late model IBM486 Processor.
<P><BR>
*** I spent years tuning up win3.X pcs and actually you dont need to go to dos to edit the files I think your
friend is talking about. If you do know how to get to dos you can go the the windows folder and type:
<P>
edit win.ini then Enter to change entries in the win.ini file and the same with the system.ini file.
<P>
Or you can use Notepad and edit those files while in windows. Both files are in the windows directory. 
Here's what too look for:
<P>
In win.ini under the [Windows] group, usually the first group, look for items in Run= and Load= and 
Device= In theory you may not need most of the background apps you may find in run and load. The
device= may be your printer so keep that but you can remove any other hardware devices there that
you dont have anymore. 
<P>
Keep in mind that you need to scroll over past the right of your screen as some nasty ware used to hide
right off the screen to the right to keep folks from seeing it when they do these classic edits to fix pcs. 
A ; [semicolon] with a space after it will disable the line. I used to use ;;; simply to make the lines I disabled easier to find later on. 
<P>
In system.ini look in [boot], again, usually the first group and look for third party software loading at the 
bottom of the groups. Many nasty screen savers that used heaps of ram used to run from there. Again, 
use ;;; to disable any lines that dont look kosher. This makes it easy to re-enable them if you shot the
wrong line. Generally with WFW in those files you can make out what the third party apps are.
<P>
The other two files you should look at are in C: ie the root directory and are called config.sys and 
autoexec.bat. Again you can use dos Edit or Notepad in Windows to view and edit/save these files as they
are just simple text files with fancy names. Since you are probably in dos 6.22 you are going to see lots
of lines there that load dos utilities and most likely your network. 
<P>
It's difficult to tell you what to keep and what to remove as that will take several hours to even write about. 
However, you can disable any line in either config.sys or autoexec.bat by simply putting in a rem with a
space after it to disable any line you are not sure about like this:
<P>
rem This is the line you want to disable
<P>
Keep in mind this same advice applies to most win95 pcs as well, especially ones that that were 
upgraded from [ie not a fresh install] dos 6.X. Once you get to win98 there's little need to ever look in
system.ini or win.ini and its best to have NO lines at all in autoexec.bat or config.sys in win98 unless its for
your new/updated virus checker. 
<P>
ps In a classroom setting you really have to be concerned with boot sector viruses especially if the 
students will be using the floppy drive. Make sure you that at least you have your computer set up for 
scanning floppy disks BEFORE any student uses them.
