Joan asks - I'm having one heck of a time getting rid of Kazaa and it's P2P networking in Add/Remove.

[I'd like to comment on] Issue 193 4) How To Record A Webcast From A Radio Station
<P>
For recording sound on the computer from it seems anywhere,  Record from Audio Input in CDex:
<P>
<A HREF="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/">http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/</A>
<P>
It captures any sound going thru the computer.  I just used it to record the Hitchhiker's Guide 3rd Phase.  
Note - You can NOT have anything else in the computer generating sound or it will pick it up at the same 
time. (eg. Beeps from other programs, help agents from MS OFFICE, etc.)
<P>
The main thing I do normally use it for is to record my tapes into the computer and then to split the large 
mp3 files into separate tracks via another program:

The mp3 splitter is a great tool.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Most Excellent Guestbook Service</font></STRONG>
<P>
The guestbook service I was using for years went kerplunk and I was even paying for it. So I spent lots of
time finding another one that met my needs and I now use:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.alxnet.com/">http://www.alxnet.com/</A>
<P>
Features:
<P>
Free<BR>
Allows you to choose the fields and create two custom fields<BR>
No banner ads<BR>
Bad word and IP filters<BR>
Multiple post delete<BR>
Can add your own graphics<BR>
Reliable, fast, and easy to use interface
<P>
I just figure that if you're in the market for a guestbook that you may want to take advantage of my time 
searching and testing out perhaps 20 or so guestbooks. It was quite an annoying task, as most of them
dont list all the features until you sign up and play with it. And many of the pay for ones dont  have all the 
features of this free one. Or, you may just want to save this link for later use to save you the time I had to
spend when I lost my guestbook.

when posting to help forums where inline images are not allowed.
