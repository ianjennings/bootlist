Kenny S. wrote - What will happen if I install a 200 gb HD and my motherboard is not LBA48 bit? I have XP 
SP2. Will it work? Will I have to partition? Will some of it be detected?
<P>
Art delineates:<BR>
First of all, if you're sure that your motherboard does not support large-capacity hard drives, i.e., disks 
that have a capacity greater than 137 GB, check with the motherboard's manufacturer to determine if a 
BIOS upgrade is available that provides that capability.
<P>
If your motherboard does not support large-capacity disks, and you install your 200 GB HD in a Windows
XP w/SP2 environment, then your system will recognize only 137 GB of your hard drive. (I'm assuming that 
your motherboard isn't too old and will recognize 137 GB).
<P>
Should the motherboard's BIOS not support large-capacity disks, the most practical way of getting 
around this barrier is to install a controller card that supports large-capacity disks, which every controller 
card manufactured today does. It's a relatively cheap fix - about $35 or so for such a controller card.
<P>
Bear in mind that if you install your 200 GB drive while the motherboard does not support large-capacity 
disks and you later install a controller card as indicated above (or install a new motherboard that 
supports large-capacity disks), the full capacity of your disk will be recognized, i.e., the 137 GB originally partitioned/formatted and the remaining capacity (roughly 50 GB - an advertised 200 GB HD comports to 
about 187 GB in binary terms) will be reflected as "unallocated space", space which you can 
subsequently format using XP's Disk Management utility. But note that you will now have a minimum of 
two partitions on that disk -the 137 GB and the remaining disk space of about 50 GB.
<P><BR>
*** Art made some good points. It's quite hard to answer such a question as it really depends on how old
your pc is. For example, if Kenny's pc is a P400 class it may just lock on post and/or not even detect that 
such a large drive is even connected. Or, it may just be a few [perhaps 3 or 4] years old which is the 
assumption here.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Clean Up After SP2 Install</font></STRONG>
<P>
SK asks - I am told that after installing SP2 that there is a whole lot of junk left on the HD that should 
manually be removed to get space back.  I don't really need the space but I do like to run a tight/clean
ship.
<P>
Alex N. notes in one of his forums:<BR>
<P>
Installing SP2 leaves a lot of space on hard disk taken up by files you would only ever need if you were 
to uninstall it. Once you are sure you are happy with it [see the following]: 
<P>
A very big restore point will have been made. Once a new regular size one has been made in the 
ordinary way, clean up by going to Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup                   and in 'More Options' click the bottom button to remove all but the most recent restore point 
<P>
Delete the hidden folder of files that would be restored by an Uninstall:<BR>
C:\Windows\$NTServicePackUninstall<BR>
Once done, if you try to use the 'Remove' for Service pack 2 in Add/remove programs, that will fail and 
offer to remove itself 
<P>
There may also be a large folder C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download depending on how you 
did the installation. That can also be deleted 
<P>
Check that the installations temporary folder did get properly removed - it will be on the drive where you downloaded the setup files, so probably C: and have a long name of random letters. If it is still around,                  delete it. And burn the downloaded file to a CD so as to have it if you ever need to reinstall. 
<P>
There will also be a large folder C:\Windows\ServicePackFiles. Do not delete this - it will be used in 
future by Windows File Protection - but on an NTFS disk you can compress it to save about 200MB of 
disk space.  R-click on it, Properties, click the Advanced button, and select 'Compress'.

<P>
RushH inquired - I want to build some slipstreamed CDs for my OS's to include the service packs but
the directions I read on the how to do it sites are confusing to me. Is there an easier or more automated 
way to do this?

<STRONG><font color="red">4) What's My Real CPU Temperature?</font></STRONG>
<P>
DILIP questions - Has anyone experienced software apps reporting different values for CPU temps than 
the BIOS? My BIOS reports 45-46C [even after a reboot]. Motherboard Monitor and Aida32 report 91-92C. 
Has anyone seen this before?  I'm baffled.  Asus P4T-M Socket 423 850 based. Pentium 4 1300MHz.
<P><BR>
*** There is only one thermometer on your PC and that's on the motherboard. Your bios reading is correct.
The other apps are not. The other apps you are using are simply NOT gathering the correct data from the
motherboard and/or the bios. ie They can NOT determine the CPU temps independently.

<P>
Neil V. posted - I want to reformat and reinstall from my upgrade xp cd. I have a 95 cd for conformation but
apparently I cant use this? Am I right and what shall I do?
<P>
Darrell answers:<BR>
You can use your Windows 95 CD for confirmation since you're going to use an upgrade XP CD.  Boot 
your system with the upgrade XP CD and when prompted for a previous version of the Windows system, 
insert your Windows 95 CD.
<P>
Tim S. adds:<BR>
XP wont upgrade [an existing] Win95 installation, but you can present a Win95 CD as proof of a qualifying product when you use the XP Upgrade CD [and install XP fresh].
