<STRONG><font color="red">1) What Is A Live CD? or SLAX - Your Pocket OS</font></STRONG>
<P>
Its an OS that boots from and then runs directly off your cdrom drive. For example, the one I tested this 
week is called SLAX.   After burning the iso to cd and rebooting, the Standard Edition magically played 
some keen startup tunes and instantly connected to the Internet via it's built in browser. Just use the logon 
name and password it suggests and then enter startx and wala.  It's a lot of fun and quite refreshing.  
<P>
I tried both the Standard Edition 190 meg download and the Popcorn Edition 124 meg download. 
<P>

<P>
In summary, if you thought using Linux would be difficult, this Live CD will change your mind. 
<P>
NOTE to people who've never burned an ISO. An ISO file is an image of perhaps thousands of files taken
from an original CD and converted into a single file. One can NOT just burn the ISO to your cd or drag and 
drop it like you may do with regular data unless you just want to make a copy of the ISO for backup. 
<P>
To make a working/usable copy of the ISO your cd burning program has to support the proper burning of 
images. For example, in Nero, its File | Burn Image. Check the docs for your application. There are
several other types of cd image files but the ISO is the most standard and most supported.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Problems With Old 16-Bit Programs In XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
thunderstruck302 asked - How come, when I try to run an older program (maybe 4 or 5 years) it comes up 
saying that it may not be safe to run a 16-bit subsystem. It then gives me an option to ignore the warning or 
abort the operation, and if I click, ignore, it just closes the box, and doesn't do anything as if I were to click 
abort.

Seems to be an epidemic lately. This can be caused by a trojan. Get rid of the trojan. [Then] update your antivirus software and run a full system scan.
<P>
Copy the autoexec.nt file from C:\Windows\Repair to C:\Windows\System32. And set Attributes for 
autoexec.nt to Read-only.

*** As an aside, often it's just not worth the hassle of trying to get your real old applications working on
the latest MS OS.  One cant expect any OS maker to continue to provide support for ancient ware.  
Actually I've been quite amazed that MS has even "allowed" so much older stuff to run on their newer 
OS's. 
<P>
In other words, dont toss that older 98SE pc out yet. It may come in handy. Or just setup your new pc for a 
dual boot like I have here at home. Easiest way is to start with a fresh hard drive and partition it into 2.  Put
Win98 on the first partition and XP on the second. Pick up the latest XP Upgrade disk which comes with
SP2 built in aka XP2. 
<P>
While I converted the second partition with XP on it to NTFS, I did it only to test out some apps. I am 
currently working on. If you do a dual boot setup you can let XP run on a FAT32 partition to make it easier 
to move files to and fro without the use of a third party utility.  Of course if you play with large files on a large
drive then NTFS is strongly recommended over FAT32.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Are $NTuninstall Folders Safe To Delete?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Daniel inquired - In my Windows folder there are a lot of $NTuninstall folders, do I need to keep these or 
can I delete them? I need the space.
<P>
Carey F. provided:<BR>
How can I save space after installing a Service Pack or other updates?

<STRONG><font color="red">4) XP Ctrl/Alt/Del Displays Empty Window</font></STRONG>
<P>
maxcamps posted - The Ctrl+Alt+Del display a empty window, the tabs are not visible, the buttons are 
not working. How come?
<P>
Kelly said:<BR>
Double click the top border.
<P>
ssengupta added:<BR>
This behavior may occur if Task Manager is running in Tiny Footprint mode. If you double-click the empty
space in the border around the tabs, Task Manager switches to this mode. To switch Task Manager to its
typical display mode, double-click the top border of the window.
<P>
Task Manager Menu Bar and Tabs Are Not Visible in Windows XP:<BR>
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=314227">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=314227</A>
<P><BR>
*** I've seen lots of people ask this question so I felt it was about time to post it. I had a bit of a time
duplicating how the problem happens but here's why. If you, while running task manager, double click
on the border next to the tabs you go into what MS calls "tiny footprint mode" which really just enlarges
the tab you are in for better viewing. If you then shut the pc off or it reboots the next time Task Manager
will open just the way you left it. 
<P>
So when the respondents say double click the top border they are correct as that will get you back
to standard mode IF you are in tiny footprint mode. If you are in standard mode and want to expand the
display for the tab you are viewing, dont click the top border, double click the space on the right hand side of
the tabs.

<P>
Charles C. emailed -  I found this file from www.nonags.com and thought that you might like it.  I have 
building computers for over 15 years, and I always look for new tools.
<P> 
I hope that you like it.
<P> 
<A HREF="http://www.ccleaner.com/">http://www.ccleaner.com/</A>
<P><BR>
*** Thanks Charles. It'd be hard not to like it.  It's called Crap Cleaner for starters, and easily gets rid of 
that pesky index.dat and also addresses Firefox and weighs in at a whopping 440K download size.  
Comes in 17 languages also and includes a preview function where it shows you in advance what files 
will be deleted.
<P>
It also has a registry cleaner but I cant say to try it as it takes years of using one myself before I'm 
confident enough to say go-ahead with that tool. In addition, while I have no problem using a registry
cleaner for win98 as part of my standard maintenance procedures, I'd recommend caution with using
one on XP, and many techs would only do so as one of the "last resort" tweaks if having a difficult 
problem.  Some techs would argue that running a registry cleaner in XP is never a good idea. 
<P>
And yes, as with any cleaner many functions are redundant with options already included in your 
browser but sometimes its nice just to take out the big broom and mop it all up in just a few seconds. 
Also keep in mind what cookies do before you go and remove them. Some of them are real time savers
on certain sites. 
<P>
ps If you were wondering where Firefox keeps it's cache files and related details type:
<P>
about:cache
<P>
In the Firefox URL window and press Enter
