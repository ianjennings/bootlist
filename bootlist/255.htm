Joan J. wrote - I have a 17" CRT monitor that I bought just a few years ago. One IT geek at my office says screen savers are no 
longer needed to save your screen. The other IT geek says they are still required. Who is correct? 
<P><BR>
*** The reason there is a difference in opinion is because it's an "it depends" question. 
<P>
For example, if you are using a standard MS windows wallpaper then you will never see any screen burn in. But, if the custom 
wallpaper you may be using has, for example, some "pure black" sections, then if you open an app and first see a white screen you 
may see burnin from that part of your wallpaper that was done in "jet black" aka 100% black. 
<P>
So, the simple answer is YES. Even a modern CRT monitor may exhibit burnin. However, even if you do see some burning, most often
it's very hard to notice and most often doesn't affect your productivity.

woo124 asked - Recently, I've noticed that I get automatically logged off from my computer if I leave it on for a long time. When I 
come back hours later, I'm booted off to user selection screen. I didn't change any settings or anything.  How do I fix this?

Control Panel | Display | Screensaver tab, uncheck the option for "on resume, display welcome screen", then go to power options 
and on the advanced tab, uncheck the option to "prompt for password when the computer resumes from standby".

<P>
Terry W. inquired - When I go to start and try to access the program menu by placing the cursor over it , nothing happens. I can 
access them by going to the C drive. Also I can't access the search, help or run menus.  It just asks me if I want to create a shortcut to 
the desktop, but can't access from there either?
<P>
Ramesh answered:<BR>
Use the Winkey + R key sequence to launch the Run dialog. Type the following command and press Enter:
<P>
regsvr32 /i shell32.dll
<P>
Reboot.

stevek posted - Can someone tell me why I have 512/456K memory total and after all programs load I have 69K available. However 
after I run SpeedUpMyPC [I get] 272K available. What is this all about? Why do I need a third party app to get back 272K of memory?
<P>
Ken B. says:<BR>
You don't need it, and shouldn't use such a third-party program.
<P>
Wanting to minimize the amount of memory Windows uses is a counterproductive desire. Windows is designed to use all, or nearly 
all, of your memory, all the time, and that's good not bad. Free memory is wasted memory. You paid for it all and shouldn't want to 
see any of it wasted.
<P>
Windows works hard to find a use for all the memory you have all the time. For example if your apps don't need some of it, it will use 
that part for caching, then give it back when your apps later need it. In this way Windows keeps all your memory working for you all 
the time.

Emily22 emailed - Hi Ed, I like your webpage and noticed that you have a  lot of text files as helpfiles. They all show up perfectly
formatted and easy to read. My problem is, when I create .TXT files for my home page sometimes lines of text run off the screen so 
my visitors have to use the bottom scroll bar to read them. How do I get them right?
<P><BR>
*** While I initially create my txtfiles in Notepad, I always double check them using DOS Edit, as sometimes, Notepad doesn't seem
to record every "hard return". But DOS Edit has never failed me.
