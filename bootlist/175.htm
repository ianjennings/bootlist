<STRONG><font color="red">1) How To Keep My Dialup Connection Active</font></STRONG>
<P>
Steve asks - I have a dialup ISP and if I go away from my computer I always get disconnected. This often
happens with file downloads as well. It's really frustrating. Is there anything I can use to keep my
connection alive? 
<P><BR>
*** Try using a pinger:
<P>
AC Plug:<BR>

<P>
Very Small Pinger:<BR>

<P>
FYI I have very few background apps on my pc but one of them AC Plug 1.2.  Their current version is
2.0 which seems pretty much the same except for that you now get to pick the URL you want to ping. Keep
in mind that some website hosts don't allow their site to be pinged. Anyway, I asked the Author why this
change was made and if he had anything else to say regarding AC Plug:
<P>
{ACPlug 1.2 used to ping www.iopusemail.com every 5 minutes. Meanwhile we gave up this URL. It also 
turned out that some people were not comfortable with this solution as the were afraid the software might transmit data back to us (which, of course, it did not). Thus we changed this in version 2.0
<P>
As far as tips are concerned, ACPlug is so simple to use, it's hard to think of any insider tip :)
<P>
But please have a look at our Internet Macros tip at:<BR>

<P>
Basically you can use this software to create the ultimate pinger free of charge!}<BR>

<P>
Michael wrote - How do you edit out excess right click menu items and add new? Many links to 3rd party 
apps- would like to remove if possible. 
<P>
Kelly delineates:<BR>
It depends on where in the right click menu.
<P>
Go to Start/Run/Regedit and navigate to:
<P>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\OpenWithList<BR>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers<BR>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background<BR>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell<BR>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers<BR>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shell<BR>

<STRONG><font color="red">3) 4.3 Gigs Of Temps I Cant Delete</font></STRONG>
<P>
Dave C. wrote - I have spent 3 hours now trying to figure out how to get rid of 56,788 files at about 4.3 GIG's worth of space in my users temp folder!
<P>
C:\Documents & Settings\Dave\Local Setttings\Temp
<P>
Windows Explorer barfs each and every time I try to delete even one file!
<P>
Randy H. suggests:<BR>
The problem is likely that Windows has some of the files open.  When Explorer encounters a file that it can't delete it stops trying to delete other files.  A simple way around that problem is to go to a Command Prompt window (Start->Run ---   cmd)
<P>
In that command prompt window, type:
<P>
del /q  "C:\Documents & Setttings\Dave\Local Setttings\Temp\*"<BR>
or<BR>
del /q  C:\Documents & Setttings\Dave\Local Setttings\Temp\*<BR>
<P>
That should clear out any files that aren't opened. Another solution is to log in as another user and try it.
<P>
Alex N. suggests:<BR>
Use:<BR>
CD \Documents and Settings\Dave\Local Settings\Temp<BR>
then:<BR>
DEL /S /F  *.*

DK4JC complains - I get this message anytime I try to install something:
<P>
The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed. This can occur if you are running windows in safe mode, or if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed. Contact your support personnel for assistance.

I am not running in safe mode and how do I know if Windows Installer is not installed correctly?
