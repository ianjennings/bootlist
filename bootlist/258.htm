Michael posts - Hi. I am running windows xp with SP2 all updates to date. No problems with the computer but I want to clean a lot of rubbish off the drive.  There is a lot of LOG .log files on the drive.  Will it be save to delete these .log files?
<P>
AndyW. answers:<BR>
Download CCleaner.  It's a free cleaning tool that cleans out all your junk files including .log files:

<P><BR>
*** The Author keeps adding features to the above. A nice one is in Tools | Uninstall | Delete Entry, for those apps you no longer
have but a bothersome entry still remains in Add/Remove. Secondly, please be VERY careful if using the "Issues" button. Again, know
how to make an independent backup of your registry and how to restore it from the backup before you use ANY registry cleaning
tools.

As a review and an aside, note that the MS Windows Add/Remove Function is NOT a Windows Install/Uninstall utility. It simply points
to the Authors "uninstall file".

Newport questioned - What's the difference between DSL and ADSL or is the same thing?
<P>
Judy said:<BR>
dsl = upload and download same speed. adsl = upload and download different speed.
<P>
Leythos said:<BR>
DSL is the generic name for either ADSL or SDSL.  In ADSL you have two speeds generally, and ADSL is generally residential 
grade. In SDSL both up/down are the same speed and it's a better quality than ADSL normally. 
<P>
Ken B. adds:<BR>
And to add to that, most of the DSL that's commonly available (in the USA anyway--I don't know about the rest of the world) is ADSL. I have ADSL here, and I don't even think that SDSL is a choice.
<P>
By the way, for the benefit of the OP, ADSL stands for Asynchronous DSL (different upload and download speeds) and SDSL is Synchronous DSL (same upload and download speeds).

its_my_dime  asked - Latest windows xp upgrade KB892130.  Automatic download.  It will download but the text says it wasn't 
installed.  Several invalid attempts. Add/remove programs shows it but without a removal button. How do I either get this installed or clean it out to start again?
<P>
Carey F. reports:<BR>

wolfmanjack81 said - I purchased a laptop last week used off ebay came with XP Pro installed (no CD) went to run genuine 
validation and says VLK blocked microsoft wants $35 for support which I feel is wrong I do not feel I should pay for support for 
something I had nothing to do with,will this prevent me from any difficulties down road am able to do windows update all including 
SP2. I have 2 volume licenses for XP but do not want to use one on this laptop is not necessary.
<P><BR>
*** Well. My opinion is that when you buy used, the first step is to wipe the drive clean and then install the OS you want to use fresh. 
So, it doesn't matter if the existing OS is legit or not. One should start fresh regardless.

Carey F. said:<BR>
Buyer beware!  Many eBay sellers are selling PCs with a bogus version of Windows XP Professional! If you are getting the following error message when attempting to update:
<P>
Error Message: The Product Key Used to Install Windows Is Invalid:
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=326904">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=326904</A>
<P>
You'll have to purchase a new "Full Version" of Windows XP Professional and perform a "Repair Install" using the new Windows XP 
Pro CD and Product Key that comes with it.  (You cannot simply change the Product Key)
<P>
kurttrail comes back:<BR>
There is no need to buy a full retail copy of XP, if you've been ripped off by a pirate. See the WGO "Genuine Windows Offer":
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/FAQ.aspx?displaylang=en#GWinO">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/FAQ.aspx?displaylang=en#GWinO</A>
<P>
Q:What are the details of the genuine Windows offer?
<P>
A:To help customers who unknowingly purchased a counterfeit version of Windows XP, Microsoft has created two genuine Windows offers for those who qualify:
<P>
Complimentary offer: Microsoft will make a complimentary copy of Windows XP available to customers who have been sold 
counterfeit Windows. Customers will be required to submit a proof of purchase, the counterfeit CD, and a counterfeit report with details of their purchase.
