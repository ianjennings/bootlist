<STRONG><font color="red">1) Powered Or Non-Powered USB Hub</font></STRONG>
<P>
Drummerboy asks - Can anyone tell me when it might be more advisable to use a AC powered USB
hub?
<P>
Noel P. said:<BR>
If you're using much more than a mouse and one or two USB RAMsticks, then a powered hub would be 
the better choice.  USB is limited to 500mA load on any cable - and a lot of devices (cameras, scanners, 
etc) unless self-powered, will use all of that for themselves.  Personally, except for mobile use, I'd go for a powered hub every time.
<P>
Toolman Tim adds:<BR>
Basically, I'd recommend powered. As you put more peripherals on the hub, the limited amount of power 
gets stretched a bit thin. If you have only one or two "lightweight" devices (self powered, like a printer or 
scanner) you're probably okay with the non-powered.
<P>
I had to go powered since I have a USB 2.0 external drive that needs a little boost. Of course, I *could* 
put a power connection on the drive, but being on the hub I have less connections to plug in when I bring 
the drive home from work.
<P><BR>
*** I agree with the answers above. Especially in this day and age of pen/usb drives. Some brands will 
just refuse to work in a non-powered hub. Buy for the future. You're likely to be acquiring even more usb
gadgets in 2005.

<P>
Concerning the revealing of ***** passwords in your last issue.  There is an easier way to simply extract 
the passwords.  The following excellent tools from Nir Soft at www.nirsoft.net will extract and reveal the 
user names and passwords and all settings for dial up accounts, mail accounts, messenger accounts, 
Netscape passwords, Content Advisor, PC Anywhere, protected storage and others.  You can save the 
data as a text file as well.  Nir also has an Asterisk Logger but I have never needed it. 
<P>
I use some of these extensively on customers PCs so I can set their accounts back up as yes, most have 
no idea what their passwords are.  In the wrong hands, these utilities can be used for, well, the obvious.  
Unfortunately, it is not that difficult to gleen the passwords from the files or registry.  Passwords keep 
honest people honest.  The link for these programs is here:

<P>
Nir has lots of other great tools and gadgets as well from many network tools, history & cookies viewers, 
driver programs, icon extractor, even a real cool weather program called Metar Weather.  I use many of 
his tools as they are truly some of the most useful I have ever found.

WCH wrote - I just bought a laptop which runs XP Pro.  I've fully patched and updated the OS.  I burn 
copies of my DVDs to take on the road (ultra portable, no external drives).  The files my software 
produces (I use a product called PocketDVD which is designed to encode for my PocketPC, but the files 
play on PCs too) are ".avi", and they play fine on my home PC (fast AMD running Windows 2000).  They'll 
play with Windows Media Player, WinAmp, etc etc.  But these same files will NOT play on the XP 
machine on Windows Media Player, WinAmp, or Real Player.   I don't understand why not.
<P>
Mrs. Gargoyle responds:<BR>
AVI files are HUGE unless compressed. The compression software used to compress an AVI is called 
a CODEC (COmpression/DECompression). The computer on which you are trying to view an AVI 
compressed with codec XYZ must have codec XYZ installed in order to see the video -- the particular 
player you choose to use is not relevant. To determine what specific codec is needed, drag the AVI into 
GSpot, and then you can do a Google search for an install file for that specific codec.

His very first suggestion is likely the "straightforward" solution you seek: install the ffdshow codec.  Aside 
from the standard MS codecs which Windows Media Player automatically downloads and installs, 
ffdshow is the only additional codec I've installed on my system, and I haven't met an .avi file I couldn't 
play in a very long time.

<P>
glenn posted - I am using windows xp. I want to copy all my pictures to a dvd so as to make a family 
photo album that plays as a slide show. However, I want to add music so that it plays at the same time 
on a compatible dvd player (that would work through a TV set). Is there a way of achieving this? 
<P>
Janely suggests:<BR>
A good place to look at for this info is:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.photo-to-dvd.com">http://www.photo-to-dvd.com</A>
<P>
It makes photo slide show video CD, complete with background image or color, background music, and 
selection menu.
