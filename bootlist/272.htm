Mr. Tighe asked - Do you have any tips on making my pen drive bootable? There isn't much information on the Internet.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Does Paper Weight Matter?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mrs. Kotowski asked - I ran out of paper for my printer and saw a sale at the local office supply store for pretty cheap reams of paper
so I bought a few packs. But upon trying to use the paper it kept jamming as my printer kept pulling 2 pages at once. Paper is paper 
so why do I now have this problem? 
<P><BR>
*** Paper is sold in different weights. There are a number of common types of paper feed errors, ranging from picking up too many sheets at a time to not picking up any. If you dont use the proper paper weight for your printer you may have problems. Often when
printer paper is on sale and stacked on a kiosk in the isle or an end display it "may" be the wrong weight for your printer.  Chances 
are your problem is due to using a "low weight" paper. 
<P>
Printer paper comes in 12 to 42 pounds flavors. 20# paper seems to be the best for _most_ printers. Check the label on the edge of
the ream. Also check which side is "up". Yes, it's important. Paper has a front and a back side.  You want to print on the front side
first.  Generally, "thin" paper may cause your printer to jam as it may pull 2 or more sheets at once. "Thick" paper may not be able
to feed at all. 
<P>
Of course one may check with the printer docs to see what weight of paper they recommend.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Do I Need A Better Defrag?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Bonnie asked - My computer geek said I should invest in a better hard drive defragmenting program. Is buying a third party defrag
app. recommended or is the built in Windows defrag OK?
<P><BR>
*** Save yourself some time and money. There is NO need for a third party defrag util. While I'm on the subject, one reason some
people like to multi partition their only physical drive is to store their collection of MP3s, videos, etc. on a separate drive letter so you dont have to waste time defragging "those" files along with your basic Windows and Program files, etc. 
<P>
Also when defragging C: it's a nice touch to first delete all garbage files eg temp/tmp/bak/Internet Cache/etc. first. No need to move
10 gig temp internet cache files around the drive during a defrag. Yes there are many free utils that will do this for you.  For most people
defragging once per month is fine.

<P>
magollinhotmailcom questioned - When I boot XP pro into Safe Mode my USB keyboard and mouse will not work. I need to log on as administrator to change the settings. Any help would be appreciated.
<P><BR>
*** Use a standard ps/2 mouse and keyboard.  Note that Safe Mode means limiting the number of drivers loaded. Or, your PC "may" 
support USB mice and keyboards if the BIOS has that option which "may" resolve this issue. Check your BIOS.  Of course, you may
not be able to get into your bios to change the settings to "support" USB unless you have a ps/2 keyboard connected. Or, your PC
may support a USB keyboard by default like many motherboards do.

"The behavior can occur if you are using a Universal Serial Bus (USB) keyboard or mouse and your computer basic input/output 
system (BIOS) does not support USB devices. Windows XP does not support the use of a USB keyboard or mouse in Safe mode 
unless the computer BIOS supports these devices."

<STRONG><font color="red">5) My Bootdisk Didn't Work</font></STRONG>
<P>
BonnieSue telephoned - I'm a new tech for a small computer repair outfit out here in rural Kansas and I just started going out on 
service calls. I know my collection of bootdisks all work but the last call I had the A: drive couldn't read the floppy disk. So I figured 
that the floppy drive was bad and replaced it but my bootdisk still doesn't work. I know for a fact the new drive is good, the cables are good, and the bios is set correctly. I'm stuck. Please help.
<P><BR>
*** Chances are the customers floppy drive hasn't been used in ages and has accumulated years worth of dust and grime. Note that
most pcs by default suck in some air via the floppy drive and the heads are most likely all muckered up. When you put your "known"
good bootdisk in the original 1.44 it failed due to dirt. 
<P>
When you replaced the drive and put the same bootdisk back in it may have transferred some of that dirt and grime to the heads on 
the new drive,  or,  your original bootdisk has become toast as it pulled the dirt/grime inside the floppy disk. 
<P>
Keep a floppy drive cleaning kit in your black bag. If the customers pc cant read their original floppy then clean the drive first using the
kit and the the cleaning fluid. If the new drive you put in also cant read disks then clean that also. I'd toss the original disks and create
another. Use a nonessential 1.44 disk to test the drive after you clean it. Before you clean a drive, blow it out good with "compressed air" and then do the cleaning.  
<P>
Note that these days a floppy drive may not be used much so your experience is quite common, but most often, easily fixed.  Also
note that on many new computer sales sites a floppy drive is NOT included by default, but it's MOST recommended that you still
get on with your new system. Many good new PC retailers, tho still not providing a 1.44 by default,  have started to  STRONGLY recommend that you have one internally and spend the extra $20 or $30 when you get  your system built.  I'd go with TEAC over a
Mitsumi.
