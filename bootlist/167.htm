<STRONG><font color="red">1) Should I Disable BIOS Virus Detection When Installing XP?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Samantha asks - I'm having problems loading XP onto my new pc I just built. It seems to get stuck after the
first reboot. My boyfriend told me I should disable the virus detection option in my bios. Is this safe? 
<P><BR>
*** Yes it's safe. Your bios cannot detect a virus per se. The function you are referring to is just a [boot 
sector write warning]. ie it's a function that is designed to warn you if something is about to write to the boot sector. Which does include, old school boot sector viruses in addition to the files your pc needs to see 
when starting up. 
<P>
Most of the time you get a chance to say Yes or No. But with OS installs this _prompt_ may NOT occur or
you may just not see it.  So, yes, disable it when doing OS fresh installs and OS upgrades so that the new 
OS can write the files it needs to the boot sector. You can re-enable it later on. 
<P>
In other words, when you turn on your PC it fist looks at the boot sector of the hard drive or floppy drive
for the basic startup files. io.sys is the classic example of a file that resides in the boot sector. This tells
your pc how to use your hard drive.

bobC inquires - When booting my machine (WinXP Home SP-1) I receive the following error:
<P>
Error loading C:\WINDOWS\System32\bridge.dll:<BR>
The specified module could not be found.
<P>
Is anyone familiar with this error and how to solve the problem.
<P><BR>
*** Luckily it's not loading. It's NOT something you want.

Bruce C explains:<BR>
Bridge.dll is _not_ a valid Windows file, it's part of LoudMarketing's spyware.

To deal with issues caused by any sort of adware and/or spyware, such as Gator, Comet Cursors, 
Smiley Central, Xupiter, Bonzai Buddy, or KaZaA, and their remnants, that you've deliberately (but without understanding the consequences) installed,  two products that are quite effective (at finding and removing
this type of scumware) are Ad-Aware from www.lavasoft.de and SpyBot Search &Destroy from www.safer-networking.org/. 
<P>
Both have free versions. It's even possible to use SpyBot Search & Destroy to immunize your system 
against most future intrusions.  I use both and generally perform manual scans every week or so to clean 
out cookies, etc.
<P>
 Additionally, manual removal instructions for the most common varieties of scumware are available here:

<STRONG><font color="red">3) How To Disable XP Asking For Boot Up Password</font></STRONG>
<P>
Glen posts - Just lately the window asking for a password shows up on boot up.  How do I get it back to 
just going into windows without that screen showing up?
<P>
Phil answers:<BR>
Auto Logon:
<P>
Start, run, type in: control userpasswords2, hit enter.
<P>
Uncheck: users must enter a user name and password to use this computer.
<P>
Xp will then ask you to enter the user and password you want to auto-logon
to. Or, download and install tweakui for xp and use its auto-logon feature.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) How To Preview AVI File Downloads</font></STRONG>
<P>
burp inquires - How do I preview AVI files I'm downloading from newsgroups without having to DL the 
entire movie? I have XP Pro and WMP 9.0 and a bunch of codecs.
<P>
Unk answers:<BR>
Download the free program, AVIPreview.exe:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.avipreview.com/avipreview.htm">http://www.avipreview.com/avipreview.htm</A>
<P>
The program doesn't need to be installed, just unzipped. Now place a shortcut to it in your Send To 
folder. Usually, movies from newsgroups are uploaded as split parts.  Just download the 1st split part 
and save it to a temporary folder.
<P>
If it was .avi.001, rename it .avi  If it was .r00 or part01.rar, then double-click it, Extract To, and check the 
box, Keep broken files  & save to the temporary folder.  If it was .avi (01/50), then right-click it and select 
Split sections, then download just that 1st piece  & save to the temporary folder.
<P>
Once you have the 1st piece of the avi file, right-click it and use the Send To  option to view it with AVIPreview.exe. Sometimes, you need to download several of the beginning sections to have enough of 
the movie to know what it's about.
