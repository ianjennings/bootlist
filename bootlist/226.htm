<STRONG><font color="red">1) Assigning Permanent Drive Letters To Removable Drives</font></STRONG>
<P>
Peter A. asks - I use several removable USB drives on my system. When I plug one in it is assigned the 
next drive letter. For example if I plug in my flash drive it is assigned I:. If I then plug in my Lacie hard drive 
it is assigned J:. However if I plug in the Lacie without having the flash drive plugged in, then the Lacie 
gets I: instead of J:.
<P>
Is there a way to "permanently" assign a letter to a removable drive so it always is mapped to that letter 
even if that letter is not the next one available?
<P>
Darrell S said:<BR>
Right click My Computer | Manage | Storage | Drive Management | Right click the appropriate 
removable drive | Change drive letter and path | Choose the drive letter you wish to use.
<P><BR>
*** It's always nice to assign drive letters for regularly used drives out of the way of any future devices. 
For example X,Y,Z. This is the same theory as earlier OS's and CDrom drive letters. I like to assign the
cdrom drive to letter R: and the writer to letter W:. This way, when/if you add additional internal hard
drives, for example, your cdrom drive letters dont get bumped up a letter and you wont have to reinstall
that favorite game that's used to seeing your cd drive on D:

<P>
Richness69 posted - I recently bought an ASUS A7V400-MX and an AMD XP 3200 cpu. Got everything 
put together and worked fine (and still is). However, everything from bios, control panel and various 
diagnostics tell me that I only have an XP 2500. Am I missing a jumper/switch or possibly something 
software related?
<P><BR>
*** There are a few different AMD CPUs with a similar model number. A quick search showed that the 
model AMD XP 3200 Operating Frequency is from 2 gig to 2.2 gig.  I didn't check all the hits so perhaps
there is an AMD XP 3200 for sale that runs at 2.5 gig.
<P>
What is happening is that you are confusing the AMD CPU Model Number with the actual operating 
speed. In other words, the 3200 just part of the model number, NOT the actual CPU speed. The actual 
speed of the cpu is in the docs that came with the chip. 
<P>
Yes, it's truly misleading. But I suppose that's the AMD marketing dept. at work. 
<P>
As an aside, these days especially with AMD, you have to check that you buy the right AMD chip for
the motherboard. Just verifying the socket type is not enough, you now have to check the type of amd 
cpu core/series eg Sempron/Athlon/Opteron etc. that the motherboard wants.
