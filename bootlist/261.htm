elaich wrote - My 40 gig Maxtor is about 2 years old. Yesterday, Windows found 2 bad sectors on it and repaired them. Is this a sign 
that the drive is beginning to go south, or just normal wear and tear?
<P>
*** Well, Windows didn't "repair" the drive, it just marked the sectors "bad" so Windows wont try to write any data to the bad areas on 
the drive. And yes, that's most often a sure sign that the hard drive is going bad. On the other hand, sometimes when the bad areas 
are marked bad you may never see any more bad areas [sectors] for years. 
<P>
Even so if it was my drive I'd make sure that my data was backed up and I'd purchase a new hard drive ASAP.

<P>
Emil phoned - Is there a 1.44 bootdisk set for Windows 2003 aka Windows Server 2003? I cant seem to find one. 
<P>
MS has published that they will not be providing a floppy disk install disk set for any OS after XP.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) I Cant Replace My AGP Video Card</font></STRONG>
<P>
Billy asked - I have a 2 year old custom built computer. Made by a local store that has gone out of business so I cant go there for
support. I bought a new ATI AGP video card with 512 ram but I cant seem to pull the old card out. I dont want to force it out so what
am I missing? I never had this type of problem before with AGP cards.  
<P><BR>
*** Modern motherboards that have AGP slots also, most often, have a locking mechanism to keep the card in place. This feature 
was incorporated after years of people complaining that their AGP cards were always getting mis-seated.  
<P>
The type I'm familiar with slide over to lock/unlock.  Generally, if you look closely, and you'll probably need a good light, you'll see
an "arrow" which says which way to either lock it, or unlock it. Often, I have to use both hands to slide it over using the "handles" at
the end of the mechanism. 
<P>
Generally, you pull the lock towards the front of the case to unlock the card.

<P>
ImaBeaner said - In the Root Folder on my C: Drive I see tons of {found} files. They are small and seem useless. Can I delete them?
<P><BR>
*** [Found.*] files are the XP equivalent of the .chk files that you used to see in Win9X. Those files are saved lost file fragments that XP saved to disk during a chkdsk operation.  Yes they can be safely deleted as they are totally useless.
