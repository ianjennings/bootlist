<STRONG><font color="red">1) How Much RAM For The Next Version Of Windows?</font></STRONG>
<P>                                                  
Plato asked - If I was buying a computer today, and wanted enough RAM for the next version of Windows which is expected to be 
retailed at the end of 2006, how much RAM should I get?
<P>
Since for XP and some modern apps like Photoshop really like to see at least 1 gig now, I am thinking that 2 gig of ram should be OK 
for a year from now.
<P>
Ken B. replied:<BR>
This is  very tough question, and requires predicting the future, which I am notoriously bad at. However, I just bought a new computer 
and had to make a decision like this myself.
<P>
I made the same choice Plato recommends - 2GB - for much the same reasons. When Vista is released, I may find that I didn't need 
that much, but if so, the error will not have cost me very much money.
<P>
Gerry C. said:<BR>
You should not be buying memory for use next year. It may be prudent to make sure the computer has the capability for adding significant amounts of extra memory when it might be needed. 
<P><BR>
*** It's best to buy a pc with the ram you will need a year from now. It saves potential ram compatibility problems if you have to buy 
new ram in the near future. Just a note that Ken B. is a really conservative guy and is usually spot on with advice. 
<P>
But yes, it does seem like a lot now but even the geeks have been fooled many times in the past and in their best judgement often
did build pcs with not enough ram.  Lets see if we take a walk through history and see if 2 gig of ram makes sense for a pc that
you will be putting the next version of windows on:
<P>
Win3.11 - Initially, was most often put on systems with 4, 1 meg simms. But, if you increased it to 8 megs for $100 at that time by 
adding a second set of 4, 1 meg simms, your pc would work twice as fast. 
<P>
Win95/95B - With 16 meg it worked fine at the beginning. It didn't take long to see the benefits of a 32 meg pc however.
<P>
Win98/98SE - Worked OK at the start with 32, then it didn't take long for 64 and then 128 to be the minimum recommended. Then 
some of the high end games wanted at least 100 meg free to use or they just wouldn't work correctly as they'd have to make 
heavy use of the swap file.  Now you're up to perhaps 256 or 512 if you are a heavy duty application user and/or gamer. 
<P>
WinXP - National brands were originally putting in 128 standard, but at the same time the geeks were recommending 256 or 512. Then heavy duty apps like photoshop started delivering "out of memory" messages unless you had at least 1 gig.  
<P>
Of course the caveat is, "It all depends on what you use your pc for".  Personally, for a basic XP user who will only uses simple apps
like me, 512 on my XP PC will be fine for the foreseeable future, unless I want to put the new MS OS on. Following though on this 
logic and the history "lesson", I'd guess that 1 gig would work for [this pc] if I was to install the next windows later this year. But, also
following though on the "history lesson", it does seem, after writing this, that if you will be doing the new games and new graphics
apps that 2 gig of ram might even be a considered a "Conservative" amount by some. 
<P>
Now lets take an example of the systems offered today by two of the larger national brands. Brand X is putting in standard, 512 ram on their Basic $369 to $500 systems. And 1 or 2 gig on their higher end systems. Brand Y is still putting in 256 in their Basic $299 systems but again, 1 to 2 gig on their higher end pcs. 
<P>
Now here's what gets me.  After going through this exercise and writing this, as in the past even the best geeks have underestimated 
the amount of ram you will need in the near, [1 year from now future even on their higher end products], combined with the fact that in 
the past the big brands generally undersize ram for price point reasons, so now, even 2 gig of ram for New Year 2007 with the new MS OS and a heavy duty user just doesn't seem to be enough :)

Click Tools, Internet Options or Start, Settings, Control Panel, Internet Options, under Temporary Internet Files, click "Delete Files", check "delete all offline content", click "OK", "OK",
<P>
Another reported cure is to click Start, Run. In the run box, type "regsvr32 urlmon.dll" without the quotes and press Enter. Then open Internet Explorer and go to Tools, Internet Options, "Programs" tab, and click on "Reset Web Settings...", click "Apply", "OK"

Now try it again.  If it still fails to work, then look here:

X-setup 6.6, the last freeware version, is available for download from here:

The newest versions are not free [7.2] but you can take a look here:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.x-setup.net/">http://www.x-setup.net/</A>
<P><BR>
*** I've been familiar with X-Setup for many years. It's a tweaking program, and probably includes more tweaks than any other 
program of it's ilk. Personally, I dont use it as the majority of default windows settings are OK with me. However, many people love 
this program and as far as I know and have read, it doesn't have any problems. 
<P>
As you may know, once a free program goes commercial or shareware very often the older free versions can disappear overnight,
so I figured that you may want to check it out and download it while the free version is still available.  I did, however, find a few other
download locations tho it took over an hour to find them:

<P>
Bungalow inquired - I am about to clean my machine up by re-installing XP.  When I have done this before I have always found that 
the greatest time is spent redoing settings etc afterwards.  I have been told that there is a function within XP that will allow me to save things such as settings; address books etc to disc, which I can the use when I have re-installed XP.  Is this the case?  If so how do I
start the process and is it menu driven or will I come across various problems as I go?

Independent of using fast, you should always have a full and complete backup of all important data, and original media for all 
installed programs.
