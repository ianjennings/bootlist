<P>
There is a lot of temp files there from the moderately heavy usage of various word processing, 
multimedia, html editing, and other activities on a daily basis, on one machine here.
<P>
Using the Fast and Safe Clean-up utility within Norton Systemworks does clear all temp files except the 
ones in this folder! Windows Disk Clean Up also ignores these files.
<P>
The files are still there on a reboot.
<P>
What can be used to avoid going into Windows Explorer at the end of every day to clear them out 
manually?

Try System Security Suite (free). Does that and a bit more.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Common Email Trojan Problem</font></STRONG>
<P>
jennsg posted -  Recently, I've been receiving these notices (with attachments) that an e-mail I sent out 
failed to be delivered.  It's always the same recipient and I've been getting them about twice daily.  The 
problem with these notifications is:  1)  I don't recall sending any e-mail to that person; and 2)  I don't even 
know who that person is.  So whenever I get these notices I just "mark as read" and "delete".  But now I'm concerned because this has been going on for quite some time.  Can someone please tell me what's 
going on?  
<P>
Malke answers:<BR>
Someone you know has your address in their addressbook. That person's computer is infected with a 
virus that sends a copy of itself out to everyone in the infected computer's addressbook. Many of those 
types of viruses (and there are a *lot* of viruses that behave this way) will spoof the "From" header. So 
the infected machine is busy spewing out these emails, some of which go out "from" you (only not really 
of course) and get sent to an invalid address. So the ISP for the invalid address bounces those emails 
back to you.
<P>
There's nothing you can do except keep deleting them - the attachment *is* a virus - and keep your 
antivirus program current and the definitions for it updated.
<P><BR>
*** Agreed. In time it will go away once the infected PC gets cured.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Gateway PIII And New 80 Gig HDD</font></STRONG>
<P>
Brett asked - I have a Gateway PIII with Windows 98 Second Edition and a 32 gig hard drive. I just bought
an 80 gig hard drive but I am having problems installing it. No matter what I try I can only get about 10
gig out of the drive even using the Western Digital Setup Bootdisk. Any hints? 
<P>
My buddy says I have to flash my bios but I want to cover all the other bases first. The odd thing is that
the bios shows the drive size correctly.  I dont see why a PIII cant work nicely with an 80 gig Hard Drive.
<P><BR>
*** Well, the bios merely reads some ID data off a hard drive circuit board chip. While it's really good
that the bios can see the drive as you've learned it's no guarantee that it will install easily.  And in theory,
you're right, a PIII era PC really shouldn't have a problem with an 80 gig drive. A PII yeah, you're likely
to run into 32 gig bios limit but you shouldn't, more or less, on a PIII. 
<P>
Before you take the risk of a bios flash, try this first:
<P>
Newer drives like cable select and/or 80 conductor cables. Yes your old drive is on a 40 conductor cable
so get an 80 conductor, set the jumper to cable select and try fdisk now. Also, since you've been into
the bios a few times by now clear it first by selecting Default settings after you've put the drive on the new
cable. Just a note when using cable select the Primary HDD drive is put on the END of the 80 conductor
cable. 
<P>
Fdisk may/will show 10 gig when doing a fdisk /status or whilst doing the format but it should work now.
Windows and chkdsk should show the full 76 gigs ie all you get when you format an 80. Oh, the other hint 
is to make sure the new drive is on the cable by itself when trying this. If no joy then you are off to trying a 
bios flash, or, a safer alternative is to install an Adaptec or Promise HDD controller card.

<P>
Marrs inquired - I have a dual monitor computer and I was wondering if I plug in another keyboard could 
two people use the computer at the same time with Windows XP?
<P>
Harry O. explains:<BR>
You will need additional hardware and software. Here are some ideas.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Can I Install XP To An External Drive?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Frank asks - I'm trying to install xppro to an external USB2 HDD so I can dual boot my laptop. But even if I 
select "option to select which drive letter to install" the external drive is not available.  What am I doing 
wrong?
<P>
Carey F. notes:<BR>
Windows XP can only be installed on an internal drive. External drives are designed for file storage only. 
No Windows O/S can be [initially] installed on an external drive.
<P><BR>
*** Of course there are always workarounds :) Note I added [initially].
