<P>
Andy posted - I have a little issue. I would like to see my folder view to be detail all the time. I have the 
change the the view to detail and then from tools folder options apply to all the folders. Every couple of 
days or so it changes back to thumbnails view. Very frustrating. Any Idea or and registry key that will 
make that permanent?
<P>
Rick responded:<BR>
WindowsXP will remember the settings of up to 400 folders, after that it starts forgetting some. See this 
from MVP Kelly for a way to increase this number:

Line 2, increase the folder view size limit to 8000

Frank inquired - The computer is a Dell Dimension 3100 with XP SP2.  I booted the computer brand new 
and installed a Lexmark USB all-in-one printer and an HP USB color Laser.  I also installed a USB floppy 
drive and the keyboard and mouse are both USB.  I tried to install a PNY USB drive, and it wouldn't install.
I then tried another USB flash drive that I use daily; the name's long since been rubbed of it, so I don't 
know the brand.  Both USB drives work fine in other computers including other XP SP2 machines,
<P>
PcEngWork replied:<BR>
You might check your USB Root Hubs for Power consumption.
<P>
My SanDisk Mini Cruzer 256 Meg consumes 200+ mA of current. Most hubs max out at 500 mA. Because 
all USB2 devices route to a single Root Hub that may limit your devices. Open Device Mgr. expand the Universal Serial Bus Controller category. Double Click each Hub, Power (TAB) and check the Power Required column. Usually, the Root Hub associated with the USB2 controller will be the last one in the 
listing.
<P>
Rick adds:<BR>
Try a powered hub, you may have exceeded the power limitations of the system's ports.

gonelzi asked - A scanner I used to have is still appearing on device lists in photo editing programs.
<P>
I have removed the software for it and it does not appear in the Scanners and Camera list in the control 
panel. Yet, it still is listed as a device in programs like Adobe Photoshop. It doesn't not come up in the 
device manager and it is not listed in my hardware profiles.
<P>
Dave P. replies:<BR>
To display hidden devices, non-Plug and Play devices, and devices not attached to the computer 
(commonly known as "ghosted" or "phantom" devices) Save the following two lines as a file then execute.
<P>
--------------------------setdev.bat---------------------<BR>
set DEVMGR_SHOW_NONPRESENT_DEVICES=1<BR>
start devmgmt.msc<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Then, View | Show Hidden Devices to remove or reconfigure these devices. Do not edit the registry.
<P><BR>
*** Or, simply hit Run and type: devmgmt.msc and then View | Show Hidden Devices. Then one can 
highlight and Uninstall them.

PeterM inquired - I just set up a wireless connection in my house, and I wonder if there is a program that 
can tell me if I have someone using my wireless system. I use Win XP Home, with all updates and I use 
Zone Alarm. I think I set up my Linksys WRT54GS device the right way, but that stuff is basically Greek to 
me.
<P><BR>
*** My son has a PSP [Play Station Portable] and he has a ball when I pick him up or drop him off and he
sees how many wireless networks there are and the signal strength. I live in a crowed area and basically 
the networks just popup one after another. Only about 1 in 10 are secure from what I can tell. 
<P>
Personally, I wasn't aware of any third party utility that could tell you if somebody was using your wireless setup, so I did a bit of research and found this:

<P>
Yes there are free ways to secure your network without using any additional software and that seems to 
be what PeterM did first. So I'm not going into that now as the question was only to ask if there was a way 
to check his work.
