booveedoo asked - Is there a utility that can be run on a file sever to give a report of directory lists, shares and access levels? We 
have may directories, shares and active directory user groups/users. Simple question, but darned if I can find a free, simple utility!

Plato posted - I'm currently using Firefox 1.0.6 as one of the three browsers I have installed.  I just clicked on Help | Promote Firefox, 
and it appears that version 1.5 is out. I am having no problems relating to Firefox that I know of.  Should I install the new version? Or, 
should I follow the Golden PC Users Rule ie "aint broke, dont fix"?  Or, in other words, are there some cool features in the latest 
release that make the upgrade worthwhile?

Actually FF just came out with 1.5.0.1 a couple of days ago. On my system, it is quite a bit faster than 1.0.x versions. Also, supposedly 
they have fixed memory leaks and security issues. So far, I like it.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Bad PS, Motherboard, Or Both?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Jim T. inquired - A friend has an eMachine T2042 that no longer starts up.  When the power button is pressed, the power actually 
comes on for a second but then goes out.  I verified this by watching the power light flicker on and off, and also by opening the case 
and watching the CPU fan start and then stop again.  If I press the power button again right afterward, nothing happens at all.  The PC 
is dead.  But if I wait a little while and then press the button again, the power comes on ... and then goes right off again.
<P>
I replaced the PSU with a couple of CompUSA-brand power supplies (both had the same wattage as the eMachine PSU).  With 
each CompUSA PSU, as soon as I plug in the power cord, the power light starts flickering and the fan starts.  But the POST process 
never starts.  And pushing the power button makes no difference.  The fan & light just keep going until I remove the power cord.
<P>
I thought it might be the motherboard, since I was getting different behavior with different different brand PSUs, but I did a bit of 
research and saw that eMachine tend to have PSU issues.  Are PSUs essential a proprietary component with eMachines?  If so, 
would replacing the power supply with an eMachine-specific PSU be the most likely solution at this point?  And if that is the case, 
where is the best place to purchase eMachine PSUs online?
<P>
M. said:<BR>
I had the same problem.  I don't know if it was the exact module you have but I think the episodes are the same.
<P>
The original PS failed.  Replaced it with a Comp USA replacement.  The system  would not power up.  I inspected the mother board 
and found a (large) 'Via" chip with a deformity.  I deduced the motherboard failed and took the weak power supply with it.  I 
purchased a similar motherboard at a local shop and it powered up.  But, when I started to load windows, it required activation.  I 
called microsoft and EMachines and to make a long story short, I ended up having to purchase windows [again].  I seems the low 
system cost at the outset is because you will pay when the system fails.  (They're counting on that).  I'm sure it's buried somewhere 
in the EULA but they probably state that you can only replace the motherboard with one purchased from EMachines.  All other 
motherboards must have a new version of windows.
<P>
nancy13g adds:
I had a similar problem with my eMachine T4080. It turned out to be the power button itself that was at fault. I took it to the shop, they
replaced it for an exorbitant amount of money, cautioned me to press the button V-E-R-Y G-E-N-T-L-Y from now on (apparently this is 
a known problem with these machines) and it's worked fine for over a year now with no recurrence of the problem.
<P>
Ben M. buds in:
From what you've described, I think that the eMachines motherboard is hosed. eMachines have weak and poor quality power 
supplies that sometimes take the motherboard with them.  In short, you've tested the motherboard with a known good power supply 
(or two), and the system won't boot.
<P>
Now, to be doubly sure, disconnect the power from all the devices (hard drive, CD-ROM drive, etc) and remove any add-in cards 
EXCEPT a graphics card (if present).  Next, make sure that the memory is properly seated in its memory slots.   Do all this with the 
computer unplugged from wall current.  Then try to power up the computer again.  If it fails to power up this time, the motherboard
is toast.
<P>
Many models of eMachines computers use standard ATX or ATX-12V (Pentium 4) power supplies.  I would encourage you to buy 
another brand, not the cheap power supplies used in eMachines computers.  I recently acquired a failed eMachines Pentium 4 box.  
The flimsy 150w power supply was still good, but the motherboard was hosed.  BTW, MORE wattage is always OK.  The wattage 
rating on a power supply is the MAXIMUM wattage that the power supply will allow.  Computers routinely draw less than the rated 
wattage.
<P><BR>
*** Wow, not much I can add to all that.  My experiences are very similar, eg if you hit the power button and the pc just flickers on and
off it's generally the power supply at fault. What's happening is, when you hit the power button which is either connected to the 
motherboard or directly to the power supply, it tells your pc to run the 110 V [usa] through the power supply and turn "it" fully on. It tries
and you get a flicker but then fails. Generally, the power supply is always bad when this happens. Trouble is, when a power supply
goes bad it sometimes, but not often thankfully, takes the motherboard with it. As said previously, one can look for a deformed
chip or capacitor, ie those little beer barrel shaped thingamajigs. A bad switch happens, but not as often.

Randy wrote - Hey, perhaps you can guide me here.
<P>
Stats:<BR>
XP2, 2 gig ram, 10 gig free on C:  
<P>
I have a legal collection of maybe 1000 DVD's and frankly some are rather rare and or pricey.  I have researched the law and it is 
legal for me to back up DVD's I own.
<P>
HOWEVER: and this is the [problem], what is the best software for doing this? I have had some success with a number of packages 
and in combination with DVD43 (decodes). I can copy a good number of these to my 8.5 Gig dual layer dvd's at a 1 to 1 copy rate.  
The problem is that some copy but the playback is hosed.  
<P>
Get 30 or 50 minutes into the dvd and it gets the stutters and quits playing correctly. I am sure that you can help me right? 
<P>
I am using PowereDVD copy2 with DVD43 and also I tried WinDVD copy and they are going thru a Plextor16 Dual Layer DVD 
burner on to Dual layer disks.  I also have a Sony Dual Layer that also has the same issues.
<P>
Playback issue is on any DVD player, as these are normally used in our TV set, the Samsung DVD player can not play them, and 
the issue occurs at the same point in the dvd regardless of player, it acts exactly like the DVD is dirty.
<P>
Walter M. replied:<BR>
Looks like aging player and/or flaky dvd-r s. You would want to burn at a lower speed, stay with a brand of known-good and 
known-to-your-burners-firmware dvds, or maybe update your burners firmware for optimizing parameters for newer dvds. 
<P><BR>
*** What speed do you burn your CDs at? Since your problem always seems to occur at "about" the same time, eg 30 to 50 minutes, 
it may be that some app that is trying to "phone home on the top of the hour" and that may be causing a burning problem. Could be anything from spyware to your printer software that you allowed to check for updates when you installed it. 
<P>
Or, the 30 to 50 minutes problem is also is a classic symptom might see if one is using bargain brand media, as even tho the burn 
went correctly, it seems to be stuttering at around the same physical location on the finished disk.  This reminds me of when people
first started to copy their music CDs years ago. The problem always seemed to too high a burn speed or low end discs or both. 
<P>
Randy answered:<BR>
Hmmm,  now thats a good question but probably what ever default is.  My guess?  fastest.... suppose that could be an issue.
<P>
p-nut suggested:<BR>
[Has Randy] tried the disks in other standalones? Sounds like the Samsung doesn't like the media you're using. You can go here 
and look up your standalone and see if others have had the same problem:

Try copying the DVD's using SlySoft's DVDClone while running AnyDVD. Both available from:

<P>
As it could be a protection issue.  Not sure if you can get trial versions?  I have used them before without problems, worth investing in 
if you're planning on doing a lot.  But yes, remember that you may get media issues, or have a DVD player that's not compatible with DVD-R.  Good luck.
<P>
mikepawlak2REM responded:<BR>
When you burn them slow down your burn speed. I have a 16X burner and I use 16X good quality blank disc's but I only burn at 6X speed and rarely have a problem, but sometimes it does happen but not like you describe.
<P>
Dual layer can burn at 2.4 speed try doing one at 1X speed or use a single layer disc if 1X is too slow.
<P>
Jonny answered:<BR>
The media type has to be compatible with the DVD player its played on.  Some do plus (+), some do minus (-).  Another trial and 
error trick I learned was that the root name on the DVD (equivalent to volume name or label on a hard drive partition) must be 
identical to the original in most cases. The software I'm using is more than a year old, was free, and no longer available.  Thanks to 
[the] film industry lawyers.
<P>
Using a standard 4.3GB DVD burner.  The software can shrink the video etc. if dual layer original.  This hints at the software's name.
