These files work in XP2 and of course Win98 and DOS. One file goes back to 1986.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) BIOS Resets To Default When Power Is Removed</font></STRONG>
<P>
Doc inquired - Is there any reason the bios would keep resetting when power is removed, even though it has a new battery, other than some problem with the physical connection between the battery and the CMOS?
<P><BR>
*** <BR>
1. The new battery may be bad.<BR>
2. You bent the clip too far upwards when you installed the new battery, depending on the mobo.<BR>
3. The bios circuit went bad on the motherboard which is sometimes solved by using an external bios battery.
<P>
Jack F. T. said:<BR>
Are you sure the CMOS (clear CMOS) jumper is properly placed on the motherboard (either not there at all, or placed on the correct
set of jumpers, depending on motherboard)?
<P>
paulmd added:
<P>
1. Cmos clear jumper set in the wrong spot. I did see a case where the metal part of the jumper separated from the plastic part, so when 
the jumper was removed, the metal part was still shorting the connection.
<P>
2. Bad bios chip [very rare]. 
<P>
3. The CMOS settings you tried caused a hang on boot, and settings were automatically reverted to default.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Thermal Compound, Board Flex, Etc.</font></STRONG>
<P>
toronado455 asked - When mounting a HSF on a CPU should the thermal compound be applied to both the surfaces of the CPU 
*and* the HeatSinkFan, or just the HSF, or just the CPU?
<P><BR>
*** If it comes in a retail box with a pad, which is actually just some thick thermal compound protected by a plastic tab that has to be removed first, then just use that.  No need for more. 
<P>
Which, if a "pad", you have to be very careful putting the cpu/fansink back on as if you take it off for a second and look at it you'll see it's actually just a thick paste ie not the type of "pad" that you may remember from the Intel/AMD "pentium" days that often came on heatsink/fans. 
<P>
As far as your question, it doesn't really matter as long as you dont use too much thermal compound. When required, I like to put it on 
the cpu then put the heatsink/fan on. 
<P>
If you are putting together a pc from scratch then I like to put the motherboard on cardboard first aka part of a corrugated box then put 
in the ram and cpu/fansink.  This is the standard way that's been done for ages to both make sure the solder points dont bend;  to 
make it way easier to put in the ram and cpu/fansink; and to minimize the board flexing.  
<P>
If however, you bought a fansink from a vendor that comes with a real thermal pad ie it looks just like a piece of 3M heavy duty double
stick tape and you can touch it and it wont rub off, then remove that and use real thermal paste.  Again, the only "pads" you can trust
are the ones that come in the AMD/Intel retail boxes that come with the cpu AND fansink.

DEBNC posted - I bought I new hard drive and was trying to install Windows XP on it and it would get to a certain point everytime and lock up. The CD has gone bad. How do I get a replacement?

<P>
DWACON questioned - I noticed sound recorder only records 60 seconds.  Is there a utility that will record up to an hour of audio?
<P>
PeeCee replied:<BR>
Audacity.  Free, Open Source, will record till your hard drive is full, edits, normalizes, filters, etc.

Or for something more basic :
