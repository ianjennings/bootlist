<P>
Vincent asks - I've re-installed Windows XP Professional but now, my previous installation's "My
Documents" folder is no longer accessible.  Is there any way I can access it again?
<P>

<P>
Over the last week I've been reading about the problems some folks were having with the new AVG 
AntiVirus 7 on systems that were also running Zone Alarm. Blue screens to add/remove not accessible, 
random explorer.exe errors, etc. 
<P>
So I put zone alarm on and then installed the new AVG Free version 7.  Sure enough, it messed up
enough things to investigate further. It turns out that it's a problem with AVGs automatic email scanner. If 
you do a custom install instead of a standard install and DESELECT the email scanner it works ok. You
dont need the email scanner anyway as it's redundant.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Cant Move 5 Gig Files To Second Drive</font></STRONG>
<P>
Xaos - I have a [second hard drive] I use it to store certain files that are usually 3 or 4GB in size. 
Apparently I cannot move a 5GB or larger file into this drive. I have already spoken to the manufacturer, 
and they said it has something to do with the file system.  [The drive came out of my old windows 98 
computer.] 
<P>
Harry O. replies:<BR>
FAT32 has a 4GB limit on file size. NTFS does not have that limitation so is more suitable for large files. 
If you only use the drive with Windows XP then why not convert the drive to NTFS? It is easy to. In addition 
to being able to work with very large files NTFS is a superior file system, requires less maintenance, is 
more stable and offers greater security. Go to Start | Help and Support and do a search for {convert to 
NTFS}

bruster wrote - I just upgraded to XP from 98se. I used to be able to check % of ram being used at any 
given time. How do I do this with XP?
<P>
Alex N. replies:<BR>
You can do it in Task Manager.  But it is very misleading.  XP aims to find some use for all of RAM all of 
the time; if nothing else it will cache any files that have been opened and which might be used again;
the code when a program exits, etc., in case you use it again, and so on.  So expect to see nearly all your
RAM in use at any time (unless you have far more than you need).  The figures in Task Manager for 
Available Physical Memory should really be [called] "Memory for which right now there is no conceivable 
use [at the moment]".  Do NOT use any tool claiming to free up or manage memory.

<P>
A new acquaintance of mine, Dag from Norway, is offering a free mirror service to nonprofit internet 
projects he likes.  Upon investigating, yes it's real and he has 750 gig/month of traffic available and is 
NOT using his home pc like you'd first guess, but a large data center in the USA with a big pipe. 
<P>

<P>
Or, perhaps you have a small business and need to distribute some large files or cd images for a month
or two. I'm sure you could work something out with Dag for a  reasonable fee.
