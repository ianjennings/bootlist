Monte C. asks - I have a bunch of programs in my ADD REMOVE PROGRAMS list that I uninstalled 
but are still showing up in the list.  Is there a way to get rid of these?

First, start the Registry Editor by going to Start, Run and typing  RegEdit Navigate to:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.
<P>
You'll see a list of all the programs available in your Add/Remove Programs Control Panel. You can 
simply select an entry from the list on the left, press the Delete key, and confirm to remove it. Close the 
Registry Editor and restart Windows.  The item will be gone from your Add/Remove Programs list.

<P>
Over three years ago Kan Yabumoto wrote a special article for this publication in regards to his most 
excellent program, XXCOPY:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/txtfiles/005.htm">http://www.bootdisk.com/txtfiles/005.htm</A>
<P>
XXCOPY was one of those tools that was, and often still is, indispensable to pc techs. In fact, I just used
it the other day to clone back a working WinME setup from a backup drive to their C: drive and it booted
right off the bat no problem. 
<P>
Back then the art of "successfully" cloning XP systems was just developing. And I recall that Kan at the
time had started work on an easier to use GUI based tool to do just that.  While still in BETA, XXCLONE
is getting good reviews so I have no problem in recommending that you try it out.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Problem Burning Bootable CDs</font></STRONG>
<P>
Janet inquired - I never, or hardly, ever have a problem making cds or music cds or saving data to cds.
But why is it I seem to have problems making bootable cds? They seem to create with no errors but
then they do not boot or get an error message "reading drive a:" while the finished bootable cd is starting.
Or sometimes it boots fine and I get the same error again. This doesn't make any sense. 
<P><BR>
*** As you might guess, I spend lots of time creating bootable CDs. Here's what I've learned:
<P>
1. I often find that I have to set the burning speed real low when doing bootables. 8X seems to be best. 
<P>
2. The BRAND of the media is often the problem. In other words, the brand you use may just not like 
playing with bootable files on your pc. 
<P>
3. The AGE of the media may be the problem. In other words, I have a buddy who stocked up on on CD-R
but when he went to CD-RW he gave me all types of still shrink-wrapped 5 year old spindles. My kids 
love all the free media, but they often give me problems for bootables.
<P>
4. I often have to close down all the background apps prior to creating bootable CDs, or even creating a
bootable CD from an ISO. By background apps I mean the ones in the system tray which can be 
temporarily disabled using msconfig.
<P>
5. By default when creating bootable CDs I make sure that the disk is also closed so no further data may
be written to it. Sometimes I forget and that's the reason for the coaster. 
<P>
In summary, I'm not pretending to be a CD burning expert, this is just my experience and what I try if
I'm getting coasters playing with bootables. Like Janet, I rarely have a problem at all with just plain 
burning using any media, speed, program, etc.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Beginner Blog Question</font></STRONG>
<P>
Justin asks - I've been thinking about setting up a blog, and I have one rather dumb-sounding question.  
I've googled and pretty much got it, except for one thing.  Must I have a "regular" web site before I can 
have a blog?
<P>
WormWood answered:<BR>
If you want graphics, music, movies, any binary, actually, most Blog hosts require you to have a 
separate web site for storing and pulling these files from there to your blog.
<P>
For one, free: <A HREF="http://photobucket.com/">http://photobucket.com/</A>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/start">http://www.blogger.com/start</A><BR>
A good free blog site with little or no ads.

dano emailed -  [In regards to BootLIST 223  1) DOS Bootdisks Cant See My NTFS XP Drive]
<P>
I know the original question was for a dos boot disk that would read NTFS drive's. However I feel you 
would do all your members a great service by informing them of NTFS for Windows 98.  It is available as 
a free download from:
<P> 
<A HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/ntfswin98.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/ntfswin98.shtml</A>
<P>
I personally use 98se as my OS of choice and quite often need to mount and pull files from NTFS 
formatted drives. NTFS for Windows 98 is completely transparent and allows me to copy or move files 
with windows explorer or what ever I prefer.
<P><BR>
*** I bet there are more dual boot win98/XP folks out there then I imagined. Yes I'm one of them :) Heck,
I still pack files in dos 7.1 using pkzip 2.04g for downloads from my website.
