<P>
Hockey Buff asks - Is there a simple, straightforward way that I can CONVERT several WAV files that 
had been captured (using Total Recorder 4.4) and then burned onto a CD so that the CD can then be 
played along with other CDs in my car? 
<P>
Hawk replies:<BR>
There's no need to convert a WAV file into anything before burning it to an audio CD, just  use the 
software that came with your burner to create an audio disc. If you have a MP3 compatible player in your 
car there's nothing better than CDex, and it's free:

ProfGene says:<BR>
WAV files are the proper format for burning a music cd.  The burning program converts them when you 
tell it to make a music cd.  All you have to do is arrange them in the order you want the tracks.

<P>
Harvey W. asks - My son, being a typical collage student, failed to write down the administrative 
password for his computer when he got it.  It came with windows XP home.  Apparently Microsoft has 
been no help.  He states that he never put a password in when he set up the computer and his personal 
account is an administrative account.  Can someone advise how to recover that password.
<P>
Unk suggests:<BR>
Recover/reset lost passwords:

<P>
Global_Killa posts -  I just got a new hard drive to replace my current backup hard drive. This should be 
easy, done it many times before. However, for some reason my CD-ROMS have stopped working after I 
took out my old hard drive, and swapped them around. I haven't even touched them, they are connected 
on a different ID cable from my hard drives.
<P>
I've double checked that all of the connections are ok, but still nothing. The CD-ROMS still have power 
when the computer is turned on, they just cant be recognized. Could it be the ID cable that is the problem? 
Wasn't anything wrong with them before, worked fine.
<P><BR>
*** Hopefully you pulled out the power plug or turned off the multi-plug/surge protector before you played around inside as modern PCs are always ON unless you pull the plug or use the switch on the back of 
your power supply if you have one. In other words, the motherboard and bios are always ON in modern 
PCs. The front Power button merely sends power to the drives and cpu and runs the boot process.
<P>
This allows features such as Wake On Lan or Wake On Modem to work. 
<P>
Or, more common is that when you went inside to play with the primary IDE cable to add your new drive, 
the IDE cable to the cdroms on your secondary channel may have come loose from the motherboard or 
just pulled out a bit from one of the cdrom drives. 
<P>
Also check that your bios hasn't defaulted to DISABLED  for the secondary IDE channel which [could]
happen if  you worked on the system while it was ON.  Hopefully you didn't fry anything.

Allan M. wrote - I have installed a hard drive (800Meg) from an old computer into a newer one. Problem is 
that the directories are all intact, but the file names are  all garbage, or not there. I dont have the old 
computer to check if the hard  disk is Ok.  Is it probably damaged or is there another explanation?
<P><BR>
*** Next time record the hard drive parameters before you remove the old drive from the pc ie heads, 
sectors, cylinders, lba/large etc. so you can set the exact same ones in the new pc using the manual 
settings. I generally just write them down on the drive with a sharpie. 
<P>
Back when 800 meg drives were sold it was usually the case where you had to manually type in the
drive data into the bios screen yourself. 
<P>
What's happening is that the new pc is seeing the drive a tad differently then the old pc did as your new 
pc is set to AUTO Detect and you didn't put in any parameters manually. AUTO often does set the drive
a little differently than if you entered in the parameters yourself.  If the drive settings are listed on the drive 
itself, try them. If not, then you should be able to get them from the hard drive makers website or by using 
one of these catalogs:

Amy inquires - I just built a new home computer and I am using the new fdisk for windows 98se but when
I go to format my 80 giger hard drive it says formatting 10,78.56MB. What is going on? 
<P><BR>
*** It's a cosmetic thing. Your drive will be formatted just fine. If I recall correctly you'll end up with about
a 76 gig drive which is correct.
