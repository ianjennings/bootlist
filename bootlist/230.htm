<P>
In the last issue I talked about hiding your email address from bots that automatically collect them from webpages for compilation into spam lists. But suppose you need to hide it from humans as well? Here 
are a few methods some readers sent me:

Tricky emailed: Ref "Hide Your Webpage Email Address From Spammers" try this link,  it is very secure.

Just received the BootLIST 229. Interesting part "Hide Your Webpage Email Address From Spammers". However in my opinion these are still retrievable e-mail addresses. Some more effort for the "bad" guy's 
would go into unscrambling a line. Take a look at and you understand what I mean :

<P>
DJ From Atlanta emailed:
<P>
Item four in the #229 issue indicates using ClearType technology to clarify the fonts on an LCD monitor. 
This addresses the issue very nicely, but in my research in my hardware standards role of my job, I have 
found that the BEST solution is to operate the monitor at it's native resolution. ClearType tech. should not 
be necessary, then. If so, it can still be utilized.
<P>
Operating an LCD monitor at less than it's native resolution (ie. 1024x768 native resolution at 800x600 
video controller resolution) usually results in "aliasing" -- and since there is NO "bleedover" between 
addressed pixels (such as there is in an analog tube-type monitor), there ARE lost pixels -- even when 
utilizing ClearType technology.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) XP Laptop Refuses To Be Fixed - I Need My Data</font></STRONG>
<P>
Henry asked - I closed the lid on my XP laptop while XP was running and now it wont boot up anymore. I called in a tech to see if he could fix it and he tried many things but no luck.  I dont want to take the 
chance of re-installing XP again as I understand I could lose some data. Is there any way to see the 
data and perhaps get it back safely? 
<P><BR>
*** Yes I understand the potential problems using the laptops restore CD and loss of data. Different 
restore CDs work different ways and yes, many of them simply bring the laptop back to factory fresh
with the associated loss of any saved data.
<P>
If your data was REAL important and you took it to our shop, we'd take out the 2 1/2 inch drive from the 
laptop and mount it in a 2 1/2 inch USB drive chassis, then connect the enclosure to a working XP PC. 
Then, in most cases, assuming it's not hardware problem, all the data would be seen and be able to be copied to the working PCs hard drive and/or then burned to a CD. 
<P>
We'd test the CD on several PCs to see if the copy/burn worked, then also make a second copy of the
data on another brand of media just to be sure. 
<P>
Then we'd put the drive back in the laptop and try to fix what's broken, and yes, try a repair install if no
joy tweaking.  So even if you have to start out fresh again and/or XP has lost your data during the repair
install we have it on 2 CDs using different brands of media just to be safe. Once your laptop is running
again if your data is lost or not recoverable we have it on CD to copy over.  
<P>
On the other hand, if in fact you really have a hardware problem, eg the hard drive is physically failing, 
then one may not be able to copy the data from it using the above method.

Ann wrote - Hi. I do onsite computer service and setup home networks. Many of the networks are 
Windows 98 based.  Often I run into a problem where a computer, or a few of them cant Browse the 
Network. The help file is useless. Are there any list of procedures I can follow to try and remedy the
problem?  I know already that Client for Microsoft Networks, NetBEUI, File and Printer sharing, and 
TCP/IP should be installed to see the other computers on the Network but sometimes I still have trouble. 
<P><BR>
*** This is probably the most common problem when setting up Windows 98 networks. Sometimes
all you need to do is wait a bit, perhaps an hour or so for the Network Neighborhood icon to work
correctly. Sometimes you have to remove all the Network components in Control Panel | Networks and
reboot and install them again to make it work.
<P>
And oddly, sometimes it just starts working after a day or two. 
<P>
Or, sometimes you have to delete the Network Card and let Win98 find it again and re-install the drivers. 
Sometimes the name of the Workgroup is not correct and matching on all the PCs, or the pc name is 
already used on another PC. By default always choose lower case letters for the name of the workgroup.
<P>
My guess it that you have probably tried all that already, but have you tried installing the IPX/SPX 
Microsoft Protocol?  That seems fix the problem on some home Win 98 peer-to-peer networks where an
individual PC cant see the network.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Cleaning CDs</font></STRONG>
<P>
Malcolm posted - What is the best way to clean CDs & DVD when they are dirty. I am talking about books 
on CD from the library.
<P><BR>
*** Dish detergent and water and a new clean rag.  Cotton underware is good.
<P>
A CD is built like like a sandwich:
<P>
Top<BR>
########### Label<BR>
########### Data Layer<BR>
########### Plastic Disk<BR>
Bottom
<P>
By cleaning the bottom of the disk you are not touching the data layer. You're only making it easier for
the cd drive's light to get to the data layer in a straight line.
