<P>
Steve posted - Since installing Windows XP SP2, my computer takes approximately 4 times as long to 
boot up. Has anyone else experienced the same problem, and if so have you found a solution?
<P>
Rock suggests:<BR>
Do some clean boot troubleshooting:

Rock adds:<BR>
It can take several days and 3 or 4 reboots for it to speed up.  First defrag.  The boot prefetch will kick in 
after the 3rd reboot.  It takes several days for the prefetch folder to be rebuilt.  And the in built optimization 
kicks in every 3 days.  After that defrag again.  If the system is still slow after some days try some clean 
boot troubleshooting to see what may be hanging up on startup.  A program may need to be 
uninstalled - reinstalled - upgraded [per what you may find by disabling startup apps using msconfig]:

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Any Problems With A 180 Gig Drive In Win98?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Boxer inquires - I want to put in a 180 gig drive and install Windows 98 Second Edition and make it one
large partition. Any things I should watch out for? 
<P><BR>
*** For sure scandisk wont work. Defrag may or may not work, most likely it wont work.  Essentially you'll 
get a [Not enough memory] error message instead. It all has to do with how many allocation units there 
are on the drive.  
<P>
In other words I believe scandisk and defrag wont work if there are more than 4.1 million allocation units 
[clusters] on a partition for a win98 pc.  System memory has nothing to do with it. 
<P>
In the past with smaller drives folks used to get the same error message for essentially the same reason
but it was caused by third party fdisk and/or cloning utilities that created 4K clusters when they should 
have been 32K clusters. 
<P>
I believe scandisk and defrag will work on drives up to 132 gig which would give you about 4.1 million
allocation units. Essentially in fat32 with 32K clusters you get 31,250 units/gig more or less. So even if you
have a 60 gig drive which SHOULD have 32K clusters a third party utility may have made the clusters 
smaller thus resulting in the exact same problem. 
<P>
I'd partition your 180 gig drive in half for best results and use fdisk to create the partitions. AND, before
you buy that new drive make sure that your motherboard can handle it or use a promise controller.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Check Power Cable First For Rebooting PC</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mr. French II asks - My system is spontaneously rebooting for what appears to be no reason. It worked
fine for ages. Some geeks tell me its my memory and some geeks tell me it's one of my applications or
drivers.  I haven't added new memory or changed any programs I have. Other's tell me it's overheating. 
What is your opinion?
<P><BR>
*** One has to start at the SOURCE ie the Power Cable to the PC. They lose elasticity over time and a loose
one may be the root of your problem. Many folks buy new PCs, unplug their old one, and simply connect
the same power cord to the new computer to save time.  
<P>
You'll often notice a loose fitting power cord to the PC. Try a new one first that has a tight fit. Same goes
for the monitor ie the old AC cords are often reused but may cause glitches. Use the AC cords that come
with your new PC or monitor. Toss out the old ones. Also plug the new power cord into a different outlet
on your multiplug and/or surge protector. ie try the easy things first before you open the case and play
with the RAM or cpu cooler.
