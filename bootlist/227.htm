<P>
RonD inquired - My computer was set up with FAT32 on both Hard Drives. Is there a way to convert to 
NTFS with out wiping out all my data? Also without Backing it up?
<P>
Ken B. said:<BR>
Sure. To convert to NTFS, you use the CONVERT command. But first read:

<A HREF="http://aumha.org/win5/a/ntfscvt.php">http://aumha.org/win5/a/ntfscvt.php</A>
<P>
Because there's an issue regarding cluster size that isn't obvious.
<P>
Converting without backing up is foolhardy. Conversion is a big step, affecting everything on your drive. 
When you take such a big step, no matter how unlikely, it is always possible that something could go 
wrong. For that reason, it's prudent to make sure you have a backup of anything you can't afford to lose 
before beginning.

<P>
Ray questioned - Can someone advise me how to make the software installed available to all users on a computer.

Bruce C. adds:<BR>
You may experience some problems if the software was designed for Win9x/Me, or if it was intended for WinNT/2K/XP, but was improperly designed. Quite simply, the application doesn't "know" how to handle 
individual user profiles with differing security permissions levels, or the application is designed to make to
make changes to "off-limits" sections of the Windows registry or protected Windows system folders.
<P>
For example, saved data are often stored in a sub-folder under the application's folder within 
C:\Program Files - a place where no inexperienced or limited user should ever have write permissions.
<P>
It may even be that the software requires "write" access to parts of the registry or protected systems 
folders/files that are not normally accessible to regular users.  (This *wont* occur if the application is 
properly written.)  If this does prove to be the case, however, you're often left with three options:
<P>
Either grant the necessary users appropriate higher access privileges (either as Power Users or local 
administrators), explicitly grant normal users elevated privileges to the affected folders and/or part(s) or 
the registry, or replace the application with one that was properly designed specifically for WinNT/2K/XP.

Some Programs Do Not Work If You Log On from Limited Account:<BR>
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=307091">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=307091</A>
<P>
Additionally, here are a couple of tips suggested, in a reply to a different post, by MS-MVP Kent W. 
England:
<P>
If your game or application works with admin accounts, but not with limited accounts, you can fix it to allow limited users to access the program files folder with "change" capability rather than "read" which is the 
default.
<P>
C:\>cacls "Program Files\appfolder" /e /t /p users:c
<P>
Where "appfolder" is the folder where the application is installed.
<P>
If you wish to undo these changes, then run
<P>
C:\>cacls "Program Files\appfolder" /e /t /p users:r
<P>
If you still have a problem with running the program or saving settings on limited accounts, you may need 
to change permissions on the registry keys. Run regedit.exe and go to HKLM\Software\vendor\app,
where "vendor\app" is the key that the software vendor used for your specific program. Change the 
permissions on this key to allow Users full control.

cherrieweb wrote - I downloaded the new updates from Microsoft, they were unable to be installed.  Is 
there anything I can do to install them.  I do have automatic updates on.
<P>
PA Bear answered:<BR>
To assure a clean, troublefree install of anything (including Windows Updates), your anti-virus application should be disabled and all other running processes closed (e.g., IE, mail client, Office) before beginning 
the install.
<P>
Richard U. added:<BR>
I had the same problem on one of my machines. Three out of seven updates installed fine. The remaining four did not. ZoneAlarm was blocking the installs.
<P>
To install them manually I had to turn off ZoneAlarm Security Suite (I could do this because I am also 
behind a router so I was still protected). I then went to the WUupdate folder on my C: drive and ran the four updates from there. I chose NOT to reboot after doing each install. Then, after installing the last one, I 
rebooted.
<P>
With ZA running I was not able to do this.
<P><BR>
*** Zone Alarm is just an example. Yes many of us install software all the time without turning off any
background programs.  Still, sooner or later you'll get stuck and you'll have to do it the correct way :)

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Is Indexing Service Needed?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Mr. French asked - I heard indexing service is not needed and can slow down your pc. Is this correct and
if so, how do I turn it off?
<P>
Harry O. replied:
<P>
How to turn off Indexing Services - Right click the C drive and select Properties. Uncheck the box next to Indexing and also check the box on the popup that asks if you want to turn off indexing on subfolders. 
Indexing Services is unnecessary. It creates a database for faster file searching but often causes a 
[slowdown] in system performance.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) More On AMD XP3200 Showing As XP2500</font></STRONG>
<P>
Vince S. emailed:
<P>
The question in bootdisk issue 226 regarding the AMD XP3200 showing up as a XP2500.
<P>
If the front side buss (FSB) is set incorrectly in the motherboard bios it may well show up as a XP2500. For 
a AMD XP3200 the front side buss setting is usually 400 MHz and the clock speed 2.2 GHz. Some 
Motherboards default power up the first time set to the lowest FSB setting to prevent frying the CPU. If the 
Bios FSB is set correctly it will show XP3200 in the Bios on power up. The confusion most people have is thinking the XP3200 is the clock speed and it is not. It is the model number. Intel markets there Pentium's 
by clock speed. It is usually implied that a XP3200 is comparable to a Pentium 3.2 GHz. CPU, even 
though the clock speeds are different.
