Beck asks - Since installing SP2 and turning off automatic updates I get an annoying bubble every time I 
start my PC telling me that auto updates is switched off and my PC  may be at risk.  I do not want auto 
updates on, but this bubble is really annoying.  I know its only a small thing and takes a single click to 
close it, but its still annoying nevertheless. Is there any way to remove this alert please?
<P>

<P>
geoff inquires - On the [XP] Task manager what is the difference between an application and a process? 
If I open Task Manager many of the processes are EXE files, many of which I have regarded as 
programs.
<P>
PcEngWork answers:<BR>
Simplest explanation is a process has no user graphic user interface to interact with, while an Application 
will have one.
<P>
Alex N. says:<BR>
An Application is something you have launched yourself (or had done for you at startup; [eg] not part of 
the [OS] system.  Processes are much more general, including a lot of services and the like operating 
semi autonomously from the system.  They will usually have been launched from .exe files

I notice the absence of a very useful utility from your DOS software selections. The application is called 
Partition Saving. It creates a drive image for backup and restoration. It fits alongside the files on most any 
boot disk, it's very reliable and of course it's freeware.

<P>
jjones questions -  Other than physical size, what differences are there between an ATX and a MicroATX motherboard?  Are there any advantages/disadvantages to either?
<P>
Dee replies:<BR>
The microATX has fewer PCI slots and most, if not all, have the video on board. Advantages and 
disadvantages would depend on your desires/requirements. You can build a physically smaller system 
with a microATX [if you] could get by [with a minimum number of] plugin cards.
<P>
Fitz adds:<BR>
Micro ATX boards have fewer PCI slots (usually 3 vs 5). They use the same chipsets, and many have all 
the features available on a standard ATX board. I've built two computers based on the Biostar M7NCG 
board, which is micro. It's the NForce 2 chipset with on board graphics (with an available AGP slot for 
video card upgrade), sound, LAN, USB2, and headers for firewire. I built them for my kids and did not 
have to add any additional PCI components. Both have been running about a year with absolutely no 
problems.
<P>
Ben M. says:<BR>
The typical microATX board has either 4 PCI slots or (3 PCI slots and an AGP slot).  The typical ATX 
board adds another two slots.  An older ATX or even mATX board may have an ISA slot or two rather 
than some of the PCI slots.  Depending on the model, both types of boards may have either on-board 
video or an AGP slot or both.  Either type of board may have up to 6 USB ports, if you count the usual pair connected via a cable to the front of the case.  Parallel, one or two serial, and PS/2-style keyboard and 
mouse connectors are almost always present on both types.
<P>
Oh, yeah.  A micro ATX board will fit in a full ATX case.  An ATX board will not fit in a microATX case.  Duh!  They have the same mounting screw pattern.  A microATX board looks absolutely tiny in a full ATX case, 
but it does the job.

<P>
geek801 asks - When I redo a computer from the ground up for example installing windows fresh I often
have to install the motherboard drivers for things like on-board sound and nic and usb 2.0 should I reboot
after each driver install or just do them all at once and reboot at the end?
<P><BR>
*** You should ALWAYS REBOOT after installing each individual driver. Yes it's time consuming but it's 
the proper way to do it.  Yes I know it's annoying having to take the disk out and putting it in again to get
the autorun to start the install procedure yet again but trust me, doing it the right way can and often does 
save you headaches.
