<P>
Vince asked - I just built a machine and have an ATI AGP card and it seemed to be working fine for a few 
weeks. Then all of a sudden I started to see it jumping or pulling in a few pixels then returning to position. 
This is very annoying and I believe it may have started with the last windows updates that came out just a 
few days ago.
<P>
Hilary K. answers:<BR>
Did you allow Windows Update to update the video card driver?  Never do driver updates from the 
windows update site.  If that is what happened just roll back the driver.  Right click on My Computer | 
Properties | Hardware Tab.  Click on Device Manager.  Go to the Display adaptor entry, expand it, and 
double click the video card.  On the driver tab click on roll back driver.

Herb wrote - Why did my task bar suddenly become twice as tall as before?  There are no more icons 
there and I cannot get it to go back to the original size by dragging.
<P>
Michael D. suggests:<BR>
Check to see if the taskbar is locked. Right-click on the taskbar to unlock it, then try to resize it.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) How To Save Service Packs And Updates For Friends</font></STRONG>
<P>
gg asks - Is there any way I can d/l WinXP service packs & critical updates (I have broadband) & burn 
them to CD for a friend who only has a 33.6kb/s dial up modem?
<P>
Tony T. suggests:<BR>
Sure - visit the Windows Update Catalog, select your friend's OS, then select the category of update 
(Critical, Recommended, etc.).  Click the Add button for each update you wish to download.  Once you 
have selected everything you wish to get, click the Go To Download Basket link.  Type in or browse to 
the location at which you'd like to save the updates, then click the Download Now button.  Then just burn 
to CD and charge him a six-pack for your time =)
<P>
Hilary K. says:<BR>
Yes, using the Windows Update Catalog.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) IE Is Locking How Do I Close It?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Jim wrote - Is there a way to turn off (close) Internet Explorer?  Some websites block the normal closing 
methods such as the X and the taskbar. I sometimes have to turn the power off to shut down but I fear
I may be doing damage to XP. 
<P><BR>
*** I understand what you mean. Some webpages are just so horribly done they can lock up just about
any browser. Generally I have to use Alt-Ctrl-Del to open up the task manager to close down IE or other
programs. Make sure you dont close Explorer, but look for Internet Explorer or iexplorer.exe.
<P>
If using XP you can also access the Task Manger by Right Clicking on the Taskbar and choosing Task
Manager or go to Start | Run | type in taskmgr.exe

<STRONG><font color="red">5) XP Password Expires In 14 Days</font></STRONG>
<P>
Bob R. posts - I have recently installed windows XP in my computer after a few weeks I would get a 
message on the computer every time I started it saying Your password will expire in 14 days do you want 
to change it now (Y or N) because I never had a password in for windows I did nothing about it then after 
14 days the computer just stopped working could not open windows at all.    So I reinstall windows XP 
again and had it validated now after a few weeks I am getting the same message that your password will 
expire in 14 days.  Does anybody know why I keep getting this message and what I can do to fix it? I think 
after 14 days it might stop working again.
<P>
Thor replies:<BR>
Right-click on My Computer then click Manage<BR>
Expand Local Users and Groups<BR>
Then click Users<BR>
Then right-click your account name, and click Properties.
<P>
Put a check in Password Never Expires
