<P>
john asked - Over a period of time I have acquired some programmes that seem to have become 
attached to the Recycle Bin. If I right click the bin it offers:
<P>
"Browse with PaintShop Pro"<BR>
"Play with VLC Media Player"<BR>
"Add to VLC Media Player's Playlist"
<P>
These seem a bit pointless - How can I get rid of these links?
<P>

You can manage the right-click context menus with the free program ShellExView:

installing. Why is this? My buddies tell me its just a silly warning and to ignore it]
<P><BR>
*** An anti-virus running 24/7 will check every file you are copying to the hard drive during an install. If it 
pauses on a file, eg has a tad of trouble reading it, or perhaps it's a perfectly legit file but is id'd as a false
positive, then the install may fail and it can be a royal pain to get that app installed properly later on. 
<P>
Check your downloads for a virus first, then disable your 24/7 anti-virus and let the darn thing go. If you
are downloading an app from a legit site, then the odds of having a virus in the download are near zero. 
<P>
Yes, many people never disable their anti-virus and never have a problem. And, many "install" routines 
for simple programs merely copy files to a folder and dont modify the registry in a major way.  So often for 
simple progs/utils most likely you wont have a problem with leaving your anti-virus on. 
<P>
But, that warning is there for a good reason.  I'd follow it especially if installing software for a friend or
if you are on a service call.  For example, I often get calls to come over and get an app to install properly. 
More often then not, all I have to do is to disable their anti-virus, delete the temp/tmp files, and try again 
and am most often successful. 
<P>
Of course, often the problem is spyware infection. So that has to be removed first. Quite time consuming.
Tiss the reason I suggest NOT installing spyware in the first place.

TypeR650 asked - I have the athlon 64 3200+ on xp pro on my hp pavilion a550e. when I right click my computer and go to properties, the cpu speed says about 790 - 900 MHZ when I first load windows.
<P>
If I check it later, it is up to 1.7 GHZ   It is supposed to read 2.0 GHZ.

<P>
Steve F. asked - I just replaced 3 computers worth of memory, substituting higher capacity memory 
modules for a pair each of 128M DIMM (RIMM?) on each machine.  I now have 6 x 128M sitting in a box.
<P>
There was a time when someone somewhere would recycle old computer memory. Do they still do that 
and, if so, any links to the companies that do it?
<P><BR>
*** Yes: <A HREF="http://www.18004memory.com/sellusyours.asp">http://www.18004memory.com/sellusyours.asp</A>
<P>
OK some of you are obviously thinking "Why not just sell it on Ebay?" Fine, but will you ever get around to
it? How about if you sell that pair of 64 meg dimms you have and they dont work in the buyers pc and they
complain and now paypal hits you with the $10 chargeback fee plus being out all your time and postage?
Heck, a bag of old RAM may be worth $40 today but zero in 3 months. 
<P>
Also, Coast to Coast Memory used to be located in my township and I've dealt with them before and I can
say that they are reliable. They've only moved once, and now I can see the street they are located on
from my kitchen window.

newbee05 wrote - I hate that my mousepad double-clicks automatically.  I keep changing it in the Control 
Panel and "apply" changes and then click "ok".  But every once in a while, the control panel resets and 
the mousepad starts double-clicking again.
