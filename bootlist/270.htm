<P>
LMO posted - My system keeps crashing. I'll be downloading something, or watching a video on WMP, or just reading mail, when everything freezes. Mouse wont move, can't even Ctrl-Alt-Del. I have to completely reboot. I have a year and a half old Compaq SR1550NX. I have over a GB of RAM, and a new ATI 9660 graphics card with 250MB of RAM. My Norton is up to date, and I 
can find no Spyware. Where should I start to look for the problem?
<P><BR>
*** Try lowering hardware acceleration and/or video acceleration. Assuming of course that you dont have a heat/fan problem.

<P>
Ms. Melinda telephoned - My children use the only PC in my apartment for homework and games. But just recently the games are
rebooting after only a few minutes of use. I haven't changed anything nor have my children downloaded or installed anything new. 
There is no problem if they just do their homework or search the Internet for information. I guarantee that there are no viruses or 
trojans or spyware on my computer. What should I check first? 
<P><BR>
*** Number 1. If you keep your PC on the floor it tends to act as a vacuum cleaner and sucks in all the dust from your apartment floor.
Number 2. Feel the side of your computer case.  If it feels warm or even very warm chances are that one or more fans are either not 
working and/or are clogged with dust and grime. Take the cover off and clean the fans with a bottle of "compressed air".  Be sure
to hit the cpu heatsink as well.

<P>
joe asked - Just built my first pc. Put my Windows XP Home disc in my drive. Upon finishing gathering info, it gave me 3 options, one 
of which said, Press Enter To Install XP, which I did. It then proceeded to the "end user lic. agreement [several pages] I scrolled to the bottom reading very little as it is far too wordy. At the bottom of the page, three options were present:
<P>
1 - F8=I agree<BR>
2 - ESQ if you disagree. <BR>
3 - Exit the setup. Or something very close to that.
<P>
I pressed F8 and nothing happened, it just hangs, doing nothing. Rebooted many times and tried to no avail. If I press ESQ it will just reboots and the process starts all over again. I'm hoping someone can give me some advice. Would be very appreciative.
<P><BR>
*** F8 doesn't work on some keyboards during the installation process. For example, I cant use my MS Natural keyboard to install
XP as it ignores the F8 key when you need it.  Often I have to temporarily use a standard PS/2 keyboard like a Keytronics or Mitsumi 
to complete the XP install.

<P>
MOTKU requested - If say I've got half a dozen apps open showing on the Taskbar at the bottom of the screen in XP.  Is there any 
way to drag and drop these apps around so that I change the order they're showing from left to right on the Taskbar? If it can't be 
done through XP, is there any freeware available that will do what I want?
<P>

Double-click "My Computer", right-click the CD writer, select "Properties", click the "Recording" tab, and make sure that the box,

<P>
Erica emailed - I'd like to figure out how to my other computer back up and running.  It's odd; it boots up into Windows (it shows the Windows thing, then I get that darn blue screen saying something about "pages in a  nonpaged area."  The only reason I want to get 
in it is because of pictures and about 2 gigs of music.
<P><BR>
*** Hi Erica. Every now and then I like to let my readers know a little bit about the real life of an on-site computer repair guy. For 
starters, it seems it's often commonly assumed that once a customer calls in a tech the tech is "supposed" to "instantly" recognize the
particular error and have a magic fix right there in their bag of tricks. Sure, with experience, lots of times one has seen the exact
same problem before and about half the time the tech can fix it using a procedure that has worked in the past. 
<P>
The other half of the time the geek has to be a detective and figure out both the reason for the problem AND, the fix for the problem. 
When one sees a patient one may ask the customer for example:
<P>
1. What was the last thing you did before the problem started? <BR>
2. Is your hard drive filled?<BR>
3. Do you regularly update and run anti-virus, anti-spyware scans?<BR> 
4. Did you just run a driver update or download a file from a warez site?<BR>
5. And other questions as needed as you learn about the system and the habits of the customer. 
<P>
Another thing to consider is that when you go out to fix a pc its NEVER only one thing wrong with it. It's always a few things combined.
And often, you may be getting an error message that has NOTHING to do with the recommended fixes for "that" specific error. As
if a computer is compromised by lets say a virus/trojan/spyware it may NOT be able to even give you a CORRECT error message
to work on. 
<P>
So OK you're a computer geek/guru and have to learn about the above error, what do you do? Well yeah you can page [pun 
intended] your partner or do some research on your own. Or, my entire site has been setup to help you. For example, for Erica's 
problem I did a search of the resources below:

<P>
As you can see tho it's not a 1-2-3 fix. Which makes it VERY hard to fix PCs via email. Or telephone support for that matter. In Erica's
case it's a good argument that her important files "should" have been kept on a FAT32 partition to make them VERY easy to
reclaim if XP is not working.
