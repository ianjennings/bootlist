<P>
Andy P. asked - I just installed an external USB hard drive for back up. It seems to be running all the time even when I  am only using
my original hard drive. The only way to stop it is by disconnecting it from the USB  or shutting down the computer. Is this normal?
<P>
Ghostrider replied:<BR>
That action is perfectly normal. It should be spinning all the time. More specifically, Windows power management does not mediate 
over the external USB HD's controller chip. 
<P>
PC adds:<BR>
External USB hard drives often do not have the best cooling built in and if left connected for a long time can stress the hard drive by pushing it's upper temperature limit. As such, it is 'prudent' to disconnect these drives if not in active use.

<P>
I've just created a predone XP quickboot diskette for download and also redid the readme file. You might want to grab a copy and 
make sure it works in case you need it. If the disk doesn't work eg if XP is on D: or other, then copy over your boot.ini file to it. Boot.ini 
is a hidden file on your C: drive, and not always easy to find :)

<P>
marful questioned - Is it generally better to install paired memory rather than a single stick of the equivalent?
<P>
e.g 2 x 512Mb as opposed to 1 x 1Gb.
<P>
If so why - I'm only thinking that to upgrade from one stick with a mobo with two DIMM slots means you can keep the original RAM, whereas to upgrade with paired RAM means ditching the original pair.
<P><BR>
*** Assuming your motherboard doesn't require pairs and can accommodate a 1 gig stick, then it's better to install a single DIMM. 
Reason being is that you would have 168 less contact points to worry about.  Then if you're lucky, the new DIMM will get along with
one of the original sticks.  Sometimes the new DIMM will only like the first slot. Other times it may only like the second slot. 
<P>
Ron M. said:<BR>
Many newer motherboards have "dual channel" capability which means they do get slightly faster memory access if the modules 
are paired.  However this capability is not likely to be found on a motherboard with only 2 DIMM slots.   Most motherboards with 
dual channel capability have at least 4 slots, and the pairs are different colors so as to indicate which slots are used to enable dual channel operation.  
<P>
In your situation I would expect that performance would be the same with a single 1 gb module versus 2, 512 mb modules, provided 
the motherboard actually supports 1 gb modules.

John Jay S. wrote - I want to upload a file for some friends that is about 200 mb. I know there is rapidshare and megaupload, but those are not so easy to use since you have to enter codes or dodge around banners ( mean for the person who will download, not me).
<P>
I was wondering if anyone knows of a similar site that will be clean from such nuisances, and provide a 200-250 upload to be hosted 
for as long as possible.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Compress Or Not Compress</font></STRONG>
<P>
Dave inquired - Does disk compression slow down windows XP?  [Assuming] I compress c:/ that contains windows. 
<P><BR>
*** Do NOT use disk compression for ANY reason. 
<P>
Ken B. adds:<BR>
Compression slows down the computer because it takes time to compress or uncompress a file every time it is written or read. On 
the other hand, compression speeds up the computer, because every time you read or write a file, there is less to read or write.
<P>
Which of these factors is more significant largely depends on the relative speeds of the CPU (used for compressing/uncompressing) and the hard drive (used for reading/writing), but on most modern computers, the result is probably a near wash either way.
<P>
I strongly argue against disk compression, not because of its effect on performance, but because of its effect on the reliability of your
data. Without compression, if  you develop a bad spot on the drive, you wont be able to read one or more files. With compression,
all your eggs are in one basket, and a bad spot makes _EVERYTHING_ unreadable.
