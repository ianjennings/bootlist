*** It seems to be the same old thing ie too many files in the root directory ie C:\ can and historically even 
in previous versions of windows can and/or may cause problems.  What often happen is folks install 
programs to C:\  instead of going with the recommend folder in Program Files or, they just copy too many 
files to C:\  to make them easy to find. Or, they unpack archives to C:\. 
<P>
Looking at the root directory is one thing I've learned to do when faced with odd windows problems, 
especially on older win9x PCs. You really want to minimize the number of non-MS files there. I did just 
cover NTLDR last month but the MS link regarding too many files in Root is new news to me so it may 
help. 
<P>
Here's the previous link/info anyway:

John inquires - I am interested in having the ability to capture motion stills to the internet from a webcam in 
my home, for security. I am also interested in being able to go on the internet from anywhere in the world 
and connect to the webcam and see what's happening in my home.

 rocasan1 posted - I received 2 Emails with attachments and extensions .ppt and .pps
<P>
Could you tell me please, how could I open those attachments?
<P>
Jim M. says:<BR>
Download details: PowerPoint 2003 Viewer.  Note The PowerPoint 2003 Viewer registers with the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file extensions only if a version of PowerPoint is not installed on your computer.

*** Note that the above link/page also includes viewers for Word and Excel. I used to have direct links
to these viewers but MS keeps changing the URLs so better to download all 3 viewers while you have
the link handy and archive them.

<P>
Wherever you go you see ads for webhosting service. But who do you choose? Who's the best for the
best price?  Who has the best support? Who cares enough about your personal or business domain
to make sure it's NOT crowded with 200 other domains on the same server which will result in slow
page loading and file downloading time? 
<P>
If you need someone to repair your roof you call your friends to see who'd they recommend. This beats
taking a chance and calling somebody in the newspaper or phone book. Same goes for webhosters. 
Take advantage of my experience with www.1gighost.com.
<P>
As you know I dont do ads, commissions, or kickbacks on either my webpage or this techletter. I like it 
that way as I can say what I want and offer what in my opinion is the best for the users of my website and publications.
<P>
Sign up with 1gighost.com and use the coupon [bootdisk] to get a $15 discount on your first year's 
service. You cant beat this company for price | service | reliability | uptime | features | support. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.1gighost.com/">http://www.1gighost.com/</A>
<P>
Just a note that even if you're not currently in the market for a webhoster at least print this out and put it in 
your physical file cabinet for possible future use.  While it's a nice 4 person/owner company they use
the best data center in Texas for your domain. Heck, if you need to call for support, one of the principles
answers the phone.
