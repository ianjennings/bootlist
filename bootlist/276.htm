<STRONG><font color="red">1) Floppy Drives And BIOS Updates</font></STRONG>
<P>
M.Adams asked - It seems new computers dont come with floppy drives anymore.  The geek at the store I just bought mine from 
said you didn't need them is that true? 
<P>
*** That depends on who you ask. Just a few days ago I drove to my local parts distributor's warehouse to pick up some parts for an upgrade to a customers computer. One of the items I installed was a brand new ASUS Motherboard. In the manual in the BIOS 
section in UPPER CASE LETTERS in a red shaded box so you cant miss it.  It said more or less [as I dont have the manual with me anymore]:
<P>
"We suggest updating your BIOS before you use this motherboard. BIOS upgrades can be downloaded from xxx.asus.com You 
need a 1.44 floppy drive in the computer to use our flash utility and to also save the existing BIOS in case the flash doesn't proceed 
as expected."  
<P>
Actually while I firmly agree that you still need a 3 1/2 inch 1.44 floppy drive in ANY pc I dont agree with with ASUS when they recommend "right off the bat" that you update your BIOS right away.  Among other things, just one speck of dust on the 1.44 media
can cause a bad flash, and, make your BIOS backup unusable. However you may need to flash [Update BIOS firmware] in the 
future to take advantage of new options and larger disks etc.  Only flash when you need to, not just because a new BIOS version is released. 
<P>
Also note that new BIOS versions often have updated features/options you may never need or dont apply to your setup.  For 
example, a new BIOS file may include a "fix" for owners of certain AGP Video card chipsets. If you dont have that particular card then
why take the risk of flashing.

<P>
Dr. Mahmahrara asked - I bought a new hard drive for my laptop and while it was easy to take the old one out the new one doesn't fit
even though it's the same exact brand. It's the type of drive that just snaps in ie no data/power cable. But this one wont snap in 
because the number of pins on the new drive and the socket in the laptop dont match. 
<P><BR>
*** Your laptop required an adapter to use the brand of hard drive that originally came with the unit and for future drives of the same
make and model. The data/power adapter is stuck on the old drive and is easily missed. Pry it out with a small screw driver and put
it on the new drive to match up the pins with the laptop setup.

PeteC. wrote - Just popped a 250-gig SATA drive into my PC.  Intended use is for it to replace the IDE drive that's being used for data.
The system drive is already on the other SATA wire.   When I booted up, Windows started guiding me through an initialization 
process.  Never did that with my other drives.  It seemed to want to default to a "Dynamic" drive, but I notice that the  existing IDE data drive is "Basic".    Did I do the right thing?

Linda posted - My 20G hard drive failed and I have installed a new 20G drive, but I cannot get it to install the OS. The Bios settings are correct, but I cannot get windows to install. The new disk was formatted for me when I bought it.
<P><BR>
*** Chances are good that the pc you are trying to install Windows on is seeing the drive differently than the computer where the disk
was originally partitioned. In other words it's always best to freshly partition and format a disk on the same pc you plan on using it in.  
<P>
And as a reminder, make sure "anti-virus" is turned off in the bios before you install any version of Windows.
