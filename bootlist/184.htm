<P>
Scratch asks - I'd like to make backup copies of my dvd on my HDD (and watch it from HDD).  But, how 
do I do that?  Any programs to do so?
<P>
Jimi suggests:<BR>
I use DvD decryptor, its freeware and very easy:<BR>

<P>
Scratch posts - I've been trying to burn iso file to CD ROM using Nero Burning ROM. Yet, every time I try 
to do so, the Nero saves a file on the HDD, but not onto [my] CD ROM.  What am I doing wrong?
<P>
Brian H. says:<BR>
Go to Recorder | Choose Recorder on the toolbar and change [device] from image recorder to your 
cd writable drive.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) I Need More USB Ports</font></STRONG>
<P>
mike inquires - I have win 98 first version. Just got dsl. It takes a usb port of which I have only two. Printer 
and digital camera used to take them.
<P>
Now I have to unplug the dsl to use the camera. It's a pain in the butt.  I bought a belkin usb 4 port micro 
hub. It is NOT self powered. It too is supposed to be plug and play. All it did was screw things up.
<P><BR>
*** Get a powered usb hub or a pci usb card with 2 or 4 ports. Personally I'd go with an internal USB card.
I'd also STRONGLY suggest that you upgrade to 98SE. Since it also appears that have an older pc your 
power supply may be underpowered as well. You might want to invest in a 350 or more watt PS.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) I Need To Add 3 More PCs To My Router</font></STRONG>
<P>
GrandMA wrote - I have Cable Internet in my Den and a 5 hole Internet Router my Son installed with 4 
holes used but now I want to add 3 more Computers because my Son is moving back in with his family 
and they have 3 Computers too with Network Adapters. The new Computers will be at the other side of 
my house in one of the bedrooms. Do I have to get a bigger Router and rig 3 more wires from the 
bedroom to my Den?  Or is there a better way? 
<P><BR>
*** It's obvious that you have a ROUTER with a 4 port switch. ie 5 ports in all, one for the cable modem 
and the other 4 are to connect pcs to. One port is free which is good as you'll need it. The best and 
cheapest way to do what you want is to get hold of a 4 port SWITCH [used to be called hubs] and put it in 
the bedroom where the 3 new pcs will be. Switches are real cheap now and a new 4 port switch will come 
with an UPLINK port. Pick up a standard patch cable 25 foot longer than you think you'll need and 
connect it to the unused pc port on the router and to the uplink port on the new switch.  
<P>
If you have an old hub laying around that doesn't have an UPLINK port ie many old ones didn't, then if
you want to use it you'll have to use a crossover cable.  Best bet is to shop online for cables because
the markup on them in retail electronic stores is truly insane. Make sure you that get one that comes with
boots on the end connectors.
