Lisa H. asked - I installed the GIMP, a photo viewing.editing/managing software. I then uninstalled it, but 
now my photos all show:  File type: TheGIMP20 in their properties. I forget what it said (jpeg?)  before I 
installed the program.   How to get rid of this?

A Shropshire Lad wrote - When I started Outlook it used to start 'installing' Visio. I deleted the correctly installed Visio program. Now it starts installing Frontpage instead.  Like Visio, it is already installed fully 
and working perfectly. Something flashes up about 'MS Installer'.
<P>
Anyone care to hazard a guess as to what is going on here?

<P>
clydeman1878 inquired - Is there anyone out there who can help me get my volume back on to my pc ?, 
I seem to have lost the little loudspeaker thing on my task bar and now I haven't got any volume and I 
don't know how to get it back.
<P>
Ken B. said:<BR>
Control Panel  |  Sounds and Audio Devices. Check the box "Place volume icon in the taskbar."
<P><BR>
*** OK it's a beginner's question, but I couldn't pass it by anymore as so many people have been
recently asking about it. My guess is that some MS or other update process is inadvertently removing it.

Farticus questioned - I installed an IOmega ZIP drive to the parallel port, it has claimed its drive position 
as C: and now my original C: drive is F:  - my D: and E: drives are still as they were. Is there a way to 
change these position, I would like to have my original C: drive back as C: and the ZIP drive as F: 
<P><BR>
*** Can you run disk management and assign the letter you want to the new zip drive? 
<P>
Farticus answered: [Yes, Thank you] I can assign a new drive letter to the ZIP drive, but [still] cannot 
change the now F: drive [boot drive] back to its original C:
