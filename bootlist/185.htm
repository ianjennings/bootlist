<P>
For those of you using Firefox version .8 or earlier .9 just came out just  a few weeks ago and it's worth
the download/install. If you're not using Firefox it's actually one of the best browsers out there and I'd
recommend that it be installed on any pc.

<P>
Mrs. Jones inquires - For years I have been wanting to get one of those colored aluminum cases and now
that the prices for them have come way down I am wanting to make a purchase online. Are there any
pitfalls with aluminum enclosures? 
<P><BR>
*** Touch the front panel of your current plastic and steel case and you wont see your fingerprints. An
aluminum case however may show fingerprints and that's the only potential drawback from my personal
experience working on them. Some colors and/or brands show more fingerprints than others I suppose it depends on how the finish/paint is done.

<P>
Mr. Wolfslayer wrote - I run Windows 98 Second Edition and have never updated it as I never needed to 
but this freeware utility I want to try says I need to upgrade my visual basic files to the newest version. I am
hesitant to do this as my system is working perfectly now. Any advice?
<P><BR>
*** MS has the vbrun6sp5 upgrade for win98/ME posted for just such requests:
<P>
<A HREF="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp5/WIN98Me/EN-US/vbrun60sp5.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp5/WIN98Me/EN-US/vbrun60sp5.exe</A>
<P>
Be careful tho as while upgrading your VB files yes that new utility will work perfectly but it also may start causing random errors and/or programs terminating in your other favorite apps.  If after you install it and 
you start getting problems there is no uninstall in add/remove for the VB upgrade. 
<P>
It all depends on how old the other programs you use are. Most  wont have a problem with the upgrade, 
but some will just drive you mad after the upgrade ie closing down while in the middle of working. 
<P>
The fix however isn't that hard if the upgrade trashes the usability of some of your other applications. 
First make sure you have the ProductKey that you used for your Windows install. If you cant find it just
search for ProductKey in the registry or use diag in a dos window or boot to dos:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/mindyll/diag.zip">http://www.bootdisk.com/mindyll/diag.zip</A>
<P>
If you haven't done so already, make a folder on your hard drive called win98 and copy the files from the
win98 folder on the cd to the folder you made on your hard drive. Then boot to dos command prompt only and/or restart to dos and run setup from the win98 folder you created on C:.  All your settings - drivers - 
desktop - programs generally will remain intact and working after the overlay install and it should fix you 
right up.
<P>
ps make sure to use msconfig | startup tab first and uncheck the works before you do the overlay install. 
After you're done you can go back to msconfig and recheck the programs you want to run 24/7 and they 
should work just fine.
