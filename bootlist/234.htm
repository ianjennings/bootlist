According to the Author:<BR>
"The TweakGuides Tweaking Companion is the mother of all Windows XP tweak guides and system optimization guides."

I'd however, describe it as a general PC and XP user tutorial. It's certainly worth downloading and 
browsing through. If you already know about this OK, the new version of the document [170 pages] was 
just published a week or so ago.
<P>
Just keep in mind that the Author spends most of his time writing, and not actually fixing PCs or XP 
problems, so much of the advice in the document has just been drawn from other tutorials or websites
without testing.

A few issues ago I addressed registry settings for the right-click menu:

Today I found a few little Context Menu Editors that do it automagically:
<P>

<P>
MMM:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hace.us-inc.com/mmm.shtml">http://www.hace.us-inc.com/mmm.shtml</A>
<P>
There is a huge difference in the way both programs work. Context Menu Editor is very simple while
MMM is rather complex, a tad invasive but fun, and has a large amount of functions. It was a pleasure 
however testing out both of them.

Friday PM a call comes in. "Hi, I need to print out a form for my son's college in PDF but I cant install
Adobe Acrobat Reader."  I figure easy appointment the caller probably has a nasty background app
that is messing with the install so I head over.
<P>
Win98SE PC, no malware, nice fast box. Sure enough, the latest Acrobat for 98SE version 6 wont install. 
Says "You need IE 5 or greater". Hmm, 98SE comes with IE 5. So I figure it's a good time to put on IE 6
anyway but wait, it's an 11 to 73 meg download! On a 28.8 dialup I say no thanks. I also dont want to 
create another problem on a otherwise perfectly working system. 
<P>
Good time to hit Google and find another reader. I found this:
<P>
Foxit Reader:<BR>

Just unpack/install to a new folder [only 2 files] and click the .exe to run. 1.3 meg download.

<P>
Ron asked - A friend gave me her computer to clean up and upgrade from windows home SP1 to SP2 
and install all the latest security downloads etc., as I have broadband. I installed SP2 OK then connected 
to the Microsoft update site. And got the message that windows was not activated and it would not let me 
download any updates.
<P>
So how come her computer has been running Windows XP home for the past 18 months without being activated and allowing SP2 to be installed? I know a couple of people who had the pirate version of XP 
Pro and they have been unable to upgrade to SP2 so they don't bother.
<P>
Ron M. suggested trying:<BR>
Try repairing the registry entries for the .DLL files used by activation:
<P>
Use Start- Run and enter the following text in the dialog box:<BR>
regsvr32.exe regwizc.dll
<P>
Then do it again with the following text:<BR>
regsvr32.exe licdll.dll

Father Sargonie Burnes wrote - G'day.  In my office we retain a local firm to maintain our computers and 
network and they do pretty well. I am pretty well versed with computers myself and can argue quite well 
with the young technicians that do the work for us and we have a lot of fun. I am 67 years old and still going strong.

The company says that reading rich text emails are never a problem if you have a virus program running.
I beg to differ with the technicians. I say that you should disable rich text in emails to prevent problems.
They say that it does not matter. What is your opinion? 
<P><BR>
*** It depends on how you are reading your email. For example, if you use access your email via a 
web-based system like Yahoo, reading your mail via your ISPs web-based client, or logging on to your company's site to read your email then it doesn't matter. 
<P>
If you download mail locally to your PC via OE, Pegusus, Calypso, or other email program on YOUR PC
then it really DOES matter. To be safe one should disable rich text aka html email in the configuration
of your client. Different email programs handle this in different ways. Some will just display the html text
making the email harder to read. Some will strip the html tags, and some wont display the message at all 
but rather list it as an attachment, etc. which of course you dont want to open. 
<P>
Here's an example of a warning and the check box to tick if using Calypso:<BR>

<P>
While some people need to read/use/modify their mail in html for work that's fine, but do so using a web-based method. HTML mail however should not be enabled on your home pc.  If you cant read the mail
simply reply and ask the sender to resend in plain text. Yes, most often one can resend to the sender
tho you may only get a blank body [no original message quotes] depending on your client. 
<P>
If one argues that "Your anti-virus will take care of any problems" then they are barking up the wrong tree, 
as the FIRST line of defense against viruses and malware is common sense and prevention, ie not 
curing the disease after your acquire it or hoping that your anti-virus will ID a virus/trojan created only 6 
hours ago. 
<P>
As with any advice there are always exceptions. For example, there are very sharp people who 
subscribe to receive this newsletter in html. I would hope that they are reading it via a web based service.
If not, then they must be very selective in the emails that they open and read.
