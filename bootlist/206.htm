Sammy C. wrote - I replaced a hard disk not the one with windows on it just songs. I can see it in device manager and on boot up. But I can not see it in windows explorer. I tried install hardware but it says it is 
already installed. How do I give it a drive letter?
<P>
Alex N. responds:<BR>
Use TweakUI - one of the XP Powertoys from [Microsoft]<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp</A>
<P>
Once installed  you will find it in Start - All Programs - Powertoys for Windows XP
<P>
Check in Control Panel - Admin Tools - Computer Management, select Disk Management and look lower 
right for the graphic of the drive. - That should show a drive letter.
<P>
Then in TweakUI, My Computer - Drives, make sure that letter is checked so as to be visible.

<P>
DoubleD posted - I have a Cannon printer and often the right hand side of the web pages I want to print
is cut off. Is there a solution?
<P>

<P>
Mike asked - How do I join files that have extensions like test.mpg.001  test.mpg.002
<P>
George points to:<BR>
Its a split file.  Use HJ Split to join the pieces.  Put all the pieces in the same folder and open the .001 file.  
HJ Split will find the rest of them automatically.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Viruses In C:\_restore On WinME PC</font></STRONG>
<P>
David G. asks - Apparently I have 7 Trojans in my system restore folder. I have disabled system restore 
done a virus scan and it picks them up but says that they cannot be got rid of.  I have tried to enable 
restore so it will purge the folder on start up but it still remains disabled when restarted.  Why will it not start 
up with restore enabled?  Any suggestion would be appreciated.  By the way I am running windows me.
<P><BR>
*** Best bet when removing viruses from a Windows ME PCs is to boot with a bootdisk and deltree the
C:\_restore folder first. Then run your anti-virus. 
<P>
While XP will most often delete the restore points when you disable system restore, Windows ME is a 
tad odd in that respect. Keeps you up on old dos commands tho :)

<STRONG><font color="red">5) New Version Of Easy Cleaner</font></STRONG>
<P>
As you know I'm not in the habit of posting new versions of utilities unless I think the new version has
grown significantly better. The new Easy Cleaner is out and I've always liked its registry cleaner function
because it's the most conservative of any registry cleaners.  
<P>
<A HREF="http://personal.inet.fi/business/toniarts/ecleane.htm">http://personal.inet.fi/business/toniarts/ecleane.htm</A>
<P>
A registry cleaner may or may not be for you.  I like them because I install/uninstall a lot and there always
seems to be leftover calls in the registry to files that no longer exist and I personally like a clean house. 
I also like to use them when doing a major tuneup on a problem pc as part of the problem solving 
process. Part of the problem solving process for me at least, is to remove any software that's not used 
which includes of course nasty software such as spyware. 
<P>
Remember never trust a Duplicate File Finder to actually tell you which files are no longer needed as no
such function exists. ie never delete a dupe in a windows or application or program file folder.  Also note
that a registry cleaner is NOT one of those utils that is a must/should have.
<P>
Look at them [registry cleaners] as a tech tool for experienced users.  In other words dont let Easy 
Cleaner reside permanently on your kids PCs but dont be afraid to use it yourself on their PCs when you 
want to.
