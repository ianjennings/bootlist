<STRONG><font color="red">1) I Learned The Hard Lesson</font></STRONG>
<P>
mook asked - Well. I learned the hard lesson of not backing up and lost a bunch of baby pictures and digital movies etc.  GRRR.
Now I'm back up with a new 80 gig HDD and looking at a 250GIG external USB2 drive.
<P>
I'd like software to do the following.
<P>
1) Periodically make an image of the 80 gig HDD (either automatic or manual).  I'd like the image so that if the drive crashes again all 
I'd need to do is restore the image to he new drive and its back up and running like nothing nothing happened.
<P>
2) I'd like to do this periodically as well with my 30GB laptop through a wifi connection.  I can take care of attaching a new notebook 
HDD to my desktop to restore the image to it.  I'm looking for reliable software to accomplish this task.
<P><BR>
*** The first thing you need to do is keep your most important data in a special folder or two and periodically copy that data to
standard 700 MB cd-r(s) with the "multi-session" turned off aka "no further writing" aka "finalize cd -no further writing possible 
thingamajig set. 
<P>
Kindly note that an Image file is a _single_ file so if it's not "perfect" ALL the data within it may be unusable if you need to do a restore.
Yes it's really nice to have your most important data plainly copied to another drive in another pc to make it easy to get at it in case
of a hardware crash and restore. 
<P>
Make sure you have at least 2 plain CD copies of your most important files and keep the sets in different places in your home, or
better yet, in a different local perhaps at a relatives house in case of fire or flood. Yes, hard drive copies of your data are nice to  have
also as a secondary or convenient backup method.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Automatic Updates - Yes Or No?</font></STRONG>
<P>
bkaras posted -  have automatic updates turned on. I believe that they're from Microsoft and they protect my computer. Is there any 
way I could know specifically what each update does?
<P>
Bruce C wrote back:<BR>
 Well, they are from Microsoft, and the intent certainly is to protect your computer.  Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that way.
<P>
I really don't like to see people use the Automatic Updates, unless they take precautions to ensure that no patches get installed 
without the user's express permission, given only after he/she has researched each individual patch to ensure that it applies and is necessary.  Due to the nearly infinite number of possible combinations of hardware, device drivers, and applications on any given 
PC, it's impossible to guarantee that all patches will be 100% harmless.  In a very small number of cases, patches and hotfixes can 
cause conflicts or other problems.  So, as with all changes to an OS, caution is advised.
<P>
All "Critical" updates should be installed.  These address serious issues that can affect a large number of computers.  There will be 
only rare occasions when a Critical update will not apply.  Of special importance are those that address security vulnerabilities.  If 
people had installed the available critical updates in July of 2003, the Blaster and Welchia worms would not have spread throughout 
the Internet the following month.  In the unlikely event that problems do develop, you can always use the Control Panel's 
Add/Remove Programs applet or a System Restore Point to uninstall the troublesome hotfix.
<P>
For the "Recommended" updates, simply study the information provided to see if these updates apply in your specific situation.  If
they don't apply, or you're not experiencing the problem(s) addressed, you needn't install them.  For instance, I have no use for 
WinXP's MovieMaker, so I ignore any updates to it.  Again, in the unlikely event that problems do develop, you can always use the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs applet or a System Restore Point to uninstall the troublesome hotfix.
<P>
In general, though, I've found it best *not* to download the "Driver" updates from Windows Update, unless they're for a hardware
device originally manufactured by Microsoft.  Device drivers provided by each component's manufacturer's web site are likely to 
perform better and offer more features than will the watered-down, "generic" drivers that those manufacturers provide to Microsoft for distribution via Windows Update.
<P>
To find out what each update does.  All you need do is read the Microsoft Knowledge Base article associated with each hotfix/patch.  Simply go to the following link, and look up the KB number of any patch in question:

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Odd Error Message(s)</font></STRONG>
<P>
Ed said - The Insert Disk window keeps coming up. It says "Please insert the Compact Disc labeled 'Windows XP Professional CD-ROM' into your CD-ROM drive [D:) and then click OK. 
<P>
I tried this and the "Insert Disc" window still keeps coming up every time I turn the computer on. I can make it go away by clicking OK, 
but I want to fix the problem and not have it come up every time I turn on the computer. 
<P><BR>
*** This comes under the general rule - "What was the last thing you did to your PC?"  Secondly, note that it is also a common 
incorrect "error message".
<P>
In other words, chances are you inserted a USB device and didn't put in the proper driver disk for it. Windows knows no better then
to ask for the Windows CD when it really may want the specific drivers disk for the device even tho you may have had it connected
for only a minute. 
<P>
On a side issue, a customer recently complained that Windows wasn't booting, was going in a loop with several odd error messages.
Safe mode and a repair install also failed. The customer said he made _no_ changes to his PC, but, lo and behold he was trying out 
new PCI slots for his new sound card and the problem happened after that. 
<P>
While I always inform folks to make sure the power plug is unplugged when playing inside as the pc is always at least partially ON if
you dont, sometimes folks forget and fry a part. In the above case the customer inadvertently fried new hard drive.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) The True Test Of System Backup Software</font></STRONG>
<P>
JPan wrote - The true test of system backup software is when you have a need to recover a disk.  That test came for me with Acronis True Image Home a few days ago.  I am sad to report that it failed miserably.
<P><BR>
***
The true test of system backup software is to first test if your backup image works before you actually need it.  Your inquiry has
nothing to do with the quality of Acronis. Same goes for backups to floppy or cd.
<P>
Kerry B. added:<BR>
The first thing you do with a backup solution is test the recovery method to make sure it works with your hardware.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Computer Restarts Automatically</font></STRONG>
<P>
Callum emailed - My computer restarts itself automatically, and it becomes very annoying, is there anything I can do about fixing this problem?
<P><BR>
*** Very often that is due to heat, generally an overheating CPU or Video Card. Often solved by adding a second case fan, replacing/cleaning your cpu fansink, and/or replacing/cleaning your video card fan/sink.
<P>
From my experience fixing PCs at people's homes, this often happens in the Winter, as many people keep their PC on the floor
next to the baseboard heat vents.
