<P>
Nick asked - I purchased windows XP upgrade version years ago, and I've since upgraded to service pack 2. Now I've somehow corrupted explorer and would like to re-install XP, but my disk will no longer let me, it says that the version installed is a later version. What are my options?

blkdmd wrote - I have Windows XP.  I have waaaaaay to many programs that automatically load when I turn on my computer.  How 
can I turn off what automatically loads?  I realized some things do need to load, however, I do not need programs to load that I rarely 
use.  I did try run:  msconfig but I do not think this is where I should be picking and choosing what opens when I power up.

Malke said:<BR>
The first thing to do is to go into each program that is starting with Windows and look for its Options/Preferences and change the 
startup option.
<P>
If a rare program does not give you the option of disabling startup with Windows, use the System Configuration Utility (msconfig) to control the startup.

Here are some sites where you can look up items you find on the Startup tab by using msconfig:

Rock adds:<BR>
First step should be to check in the options for the program you don't want to start and see if there is a setting to tell it not to run at 
startup.  The next step is to remove any entries you don't want from the two startup folders:
<P>
C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Start Menu\Programs\Startup<BR>
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
<P>
For anything else uncheck their entries in the startup tab of msconfig: Start | Run | Msconfig | Ok
<P>
Another option is to remove the reference to them from one of these keys in the registry:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<BR>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce<BR>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<BR>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
<P>
Make sure you have a backup of the registry using a program like ERUNT before making any changes to the registry.

Jim B. said:<BR>
There are several approaches you can use to make controlling the Startup process easier.  In addition to using msconfig:
<P>
Go here and get Mike Lin's Startup Control Panel applet:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml">http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml</A>
<P>
A somewhat more difficult to use but more extensive program to do the same thing is StartupList from here:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lurkhere.com/~nicefiles/index.html">http://www.lurkhere.com/~nicefiles/index.html</A>
<P>
Or even better, Autoruns from here. This one shows many additional useful/critical Registry entries. Recommended:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/autoruns.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/autoruns.shtml</A>
<P>
Changes made with StartUpCPL are less likely to cause problems, and are usually a matter of just re-enabling the particular 
program.
<P>
Another program of this type that I can recommend is StartMan, free.  You'll have to get it here as the pcforest site is, sadly, no longer 
in business:<BR>  
<A HREF="http://www.pt.lu/comnet/files/utils/startman10396.exe">http://www.pt.lu/comnet/files/utils/startman10396.exe</A>
<P>
Another such free program that I can highly recommend is StartupRun, here, particularly if you suspect malware
problems - it has a lot of useful info including file creation dates:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/strun.html">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/strun.html</A>

And finally, StartupCop, is excellent and allows you to set up multiple "startup profiles":<BR>

<P>
AdamJ posted -   I seem to be having quite a bit of trouble with my internet at the moment and the way I have been managing to fix it 
is by using system restore to take my pc back to better times when the internet DID work.  But yesterday I had the same problem 
again and [when] I went to system restore BUT all my restore points had been deleted. 
<P><BR>
*** At first glance I'd say your C: drive is full. That would account for no space for Internet cache files, thus the Internet problem, and,
the lack of restore points. XP will auto delete system restore points to free up space on C:.

Andy M. asked - Any good sites for newbies to wireless networking? I want to have 2 PC's & 1 laptop connect wirelessly & would like 
to know what hardware I need.
<P>
Duane A. answered:<BR>
You need a wire/wireless NAT router and wireless cards. You should have one machine that can connect to the router by wire as wireless can be flakey. And  besides, you have to configure the router on the wireless to even have wireless and you got to do it via 
a wire machine first.

<A HREF="http://www.bootdisk.com/bootlist/247.htm#2">http://www.bootdisk.com/bootlist/247.htm#2</A>
<P>
Gary C. emailed me and said he had created an Excel sheet listing the commands in a logical order. Here is his letter:
<P>
"I have been getting your updates for many years, and I have benefited often from what I have found in them. Recently there was one on MS keyboard shortcuts. I went to MS's website and copied all the window's shortcuts to a word file. I then realized that it was not really usable from the point of view of an end user. From my perspective I want to find the action and then determine the shortcut. I have attached an excel file which orders the shortcuts alphabetically by action. The first tab ("all") contains all the shortcuts ready to print. Then there are tabs for each group separately ("general", "windows explorer," "internet explorer," etc). Maybe this would be helpful to some other people."
<P><BR>
*** It's auto set to print in landscape mode and while your printer ware may tell you ten pages, the first five have all the data. I printed it out using Excel 97. Nice job Gary, many thanks. Here is the file:
