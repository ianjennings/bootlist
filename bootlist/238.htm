<STRONG><font color="red">1) Cleaning Laptop Screens</font></STRONG>
<P>
tonita asked - Does anyone know what will keep the screen clean on a laptop?  I bought something that
was supposed to be able to clean it but it just streaked it somewhat.  Now I hope there is something that 
will clean it properly.

*** First I hope that tonita hasn't ruined her laptop screen by using a product not designed specifically
for laptop screens.  Background: CRT screens are leaded glass and Windex, an ammonia based 
product, works fine.  Laptop screens are plastic and often contain special coatings so products that 
contain ammonia should not be used. 
<P>
Those of you who ever bought lens cleaner for your camera lens did so because modern lenses had
anti-glare coatings over the glass so you had to use a special cleaning fluid, which was generally made 
of water and isopropyl alcohol. 3M markets special cleaning wipes for laptop screens available at many online dealers and in stores. Their wipes are essentially "lens cleaner"  [isopropyl alcohol+ water] on 
lens cleaning paper. 
<P>
One can easily use google to find an online retailer for the 3M wipes.

David R. adds:<BR>
There's a very good product for eye glasses and all kinds of glass and plastic called See Clear made 
by Environmental Care Products, Inc. in Canada.  They work very well and you can get them at Costco or Sam's Club in a box of 100 wipes.
<P>
Or, you can get them online here:

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Attaching Large Files To An Email</font></STRONG>
<P>
Sigi R. asked - I am presently using Yahoo when sending attached files up to 10 MB. That's about the limit for free email accounts. Is there any free provider that allows to send more than 10 MB in one go, or an inexpensive service that offers such a thing?
<P>
TJ said:<BR>
Tons of 'em.  I like this one. Files up to 1GB:

Upload-limit: Unlimited! (Max. 50 MB per file! Split-archives allowed!)

*** To clarify, with the above you're not actually attaching the file to an email, but merely providing a link
in your email to download the file from the free services' website. In many cases this may be better as
many people have small size limits on their mailboxes.

Mr. Finch wrote - I use CorelDRAW at work and would like to have it at home, but it costs $264. Is there any
comparable program you know of that does the same but cost a lot less?

*** Try InkScape. Freeware:

<P>
Pisces6 posted - [I used to have an easy way other than using the character map to create special
characters. Now I lost it after I reloaded XP]. 
<P>
Ken B. responded:<BR>
There  are several ways to do this. I use a little freeware background program called AllChars. This lets 
me type many common special characters (many of these are used in other languages) by pressing the 
ctrl key followed by a two character mnemonic combination.
<P>
For example, for � the two characters are ~ and n. For � it's c and , For � it's u and ". Go to:

<P><BR>
*** Note that Ken said several ways, and at least two of the "other ways" are already built into windows.
However, sometimes special dedicated utils are faster, easier, have added features, or are even more 
fun to use :)
