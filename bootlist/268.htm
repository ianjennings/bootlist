<STRONG><font color="red">1) "A" Backup Strategy</font></STRONG>
<P>
Victor asked - I've just installed a 750gb hard drive and now would like to buy an additional drive for backups.   Maxtor has an 
external 1000gb drive formatted RAID 0 or 1.  I could also just buy another 750gb internal drive.  Which would be better in the long run?
<P>
Ken B. said:<BR>
RAID 0 (striping) uses two or more drives together as a single drive to improve performance. It would do nothing for you regarding backups.
<P>
RAID 1 (mirroring) uses two or more drives, each a duplicate of the others, to provide redundancy. It's used in situations where any downtown can't be tolerated, because the way it works is that if one drive fails the other takes over seamlessly. Although some 
people thing of RAID 1 as a backup technique, that is *not* what it is, since it's subject to simultaneous loss of the original and the 
mirror to many of the most common dangers threatening your data--severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, 
theft of the computer, etc.  Most companies that use RAID 1 also have a strong external backup plan in place.
<P>
Moreover, an individual drive can't be formatted RAID 0 or RAID 1; it's the array of multiple drives that are RAIDed. To RAID the 
drive, you need a controller that supports it (there's also software RAID, but I understand it performs poorly). Also, as far as I know 
(you should check to be sure I'm right), the two drives would have to be the same size and you can't RAID a 1000GB drive with a 
750GB one (or if you can, you could only use 750GB of the 1000GB drive).
<P>
Regarding buying an internal 750GB drive, I never recommend using an internal drive for backup, again because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer.
<P>
In my view, secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer. For really secure backup (needed, for example, if the life of your business depends on your data) you should have multiple generations of backup, and at least one of 
those generations should be stored off-site.
<P>
My computer isn't used for business, but my personal backup scheme uses two identical removable hard drives, I alternate between 
the two, and use Drive Image to make a complete copy of the primary drive.  So if I were you, I would buy the 750 internal drive and 
put it in an inexpensive external USB enclosure.
<P>
Kerry B. replied:<BR>
External is better for backups. It can be turned off or better yet disconnected and stored elsewhere when not in use.
<P>
Victor wrote back:<BR>
So if I were you, I would buy the 750 internal drive and put it in an inexpensive external USB enclosure.  This sounds like a great idea.  How do I do this?  Thanks.
<P>
Shenan S. added:<BR>
Just like you stated. Buy an external case that will accept the 750GB drive and buy the drive and put it in the case. I would not (still) 
trust only a hard drive (external or not) for my data backups.  I would still maintain some removable media you take "offsite" on 
a periodic basis.
<P>
Ken B. also added:<BR>
Just as I said: buy a USB drive enclosure. You can find them for sale on the internet for $20 or so and up. Do a google search.
Inserting the drive in the case is very easy and takes just a couple of minutes. The enclosure will come with instructions.

Philip questioned - Why is it that when I save a new favorite there is a recognizable symbol from the site. When I reboot the symbol is gone and the internet explorer browser symbol takes its place.
<P><BR>
*** You may have set a util or browser function to autodelete cache files on reboot.
