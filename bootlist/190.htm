Terry asks - We have laptop users and we want to check if they have downloaded particular service 
packs +KB's and Q's. I do not want to use any third party software - just trying to find out where the 
information is located.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Is Thermal Paste Needed For New Retail AMDs?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Triangle Man inquires - I'm 55 years old and have built a few computers myself and now I will be
constructing a computer with an AMD Processor. I have two teenage sons and both of them and their
friends say that even if I buy an AMD Processor Retail Version which comes with the fan and heatsink that
I should scrape off the thermal pad and use thermal paste or my processor will overheat. I tend to trust
AMD but I seem to be outnumbered in opinions. Any help?
<P><BR>
*** Your teenage sons and their friends are a tad misinformed.  The retail AMDs dont come with a thermal 
pad they come with a thick paste which is protected by a plastic strip which you remove before installing 
the fansink on the CPU. If you do the install correctly your processor will operate just fine. 
<P>
As an aside, when putting a new pc together, get some corrugated paper from the side of a box or 
something for your work surface.  Put the motherboard on it and install your ram, cpu, and fansink, THEN
mount the motherboard in the case. Then put in your video card, if its separate, and see if she tries to 
start up. 
<P>
If she tries to start and you get a floppy disk fail or whatever then you're in luck. Now it's time to start 
adding your drives.  Personally once your floppy and hard/cd drives are in I like to install windows and 
get it going and then install the video card/chip/motherboard drivers if required. After that then I'll add
any other card(s) one at a time reading the docs first as many cards want you to install the drivers first.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) A Case For Case Fans</font></STRONG>
<P>
Superstar Swass posted - Unless you've got more (or far more powerful) intake fans than exhaust fans,
then it seems like the intake fans are a waste.
<P><BR>
*** Many pcs have only one spot to put a second fan in and that's often in front-bottom.  If so then you 
make that an intake. If the only spot you have is in back under the power supply then you make that an 
exhaust. Many newer PCs dont have a spot in front at that space is now being commonly used for items 
like USB and/or sound connectors. 
<P>
Most PCs are fine right out of the box with only the power supply fan doing all the work. Note however, that 
a good majority of pc cases do have a spot for an additional fan for a good reason. When you start 
adding additional hard drives or super duper video cards the additional cooling is recommended. 
<P>
A second case fan may however, be good insurance even if you have a basic system. Reason being 
is that the power supply acts like a vacuum cleaner and accumulates hoards of dust inside resulting in 
poor airflow over time. The second fan will help during the period between blowing out your PS when 
you open the case for general maintenance and/or adding new hardware.
<P>
In addition, a second case fan let's say in back blowing out will really help minimize the dust/grime that
your power supply sucks in resulting in your power supply lasting longer.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Three Ways To Delete Old Restore Points</font></STRONG>
<P>
Russ asks - I am running XP Pro. I would like to delete all past restore points and then enable restore 
again. Is this possible?
<P>
Rick answers:<BR>
Sure is. There are three ways to easily remove restore points (you should not do this selectively).
<P>
1) Start/run cleanmgr.exe (disk cleanup), there is a CLEAN UP button on the more options tab to remove 
all but the newest restore point.
<P>
2) Control Panel/System/System Restore tab, go to settings and REDUCE the amount of space allotted to 
System Restore. This will remove older restore points, how many depends on how much space you 
require for a point, and how much space you leave.
<P>
3) Control Panel/System/System Restore tab, click the TURN OFF system restore on all drives box. This 
will eliminate all restore points. Once re enabled, the system will begin creating new ones. You should 
reboot in between doing this.
