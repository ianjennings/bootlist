<P>
janet s. asks - [I get this message when I try to use my official MS Key to install XP] The product key used 
to install Windows is not valid. Please contact your system administrator or retailer immediately to obtain 
a valid product key.
<P>
mrajesh24 suggests:<BR>
Ensure that you are entering the product key correctly. [Some of] the following characters can mislead you:
<P>
0 (zero) and O (capital O)<BR>
1 (one) and l (the character l in lower case)<BR>
5 (five) and S (the character S in upper case)

LISA wrote - A friends daughter was playing a game on their pc not sure if it was an online game or just 
one installed on their pc but  after she played the game the screen is upside down everything is upside 
down icons even if a file is opened it is upside down any ideas what might have happened and do
you know how to fix it?
<P>
Alex N. suggests:<BR>
R-click in the Desktop, take Properties.  Settings page click Advanced.
Depending on the video card:
<P>
ATI Radeons, look for a Rotation page.
<P>
NVidia look for a GForce page and in that for Rotation.
<P>
These cards are providing for rotation of the display  in 90 degree steps for use with LCD monitors that 
can be swung round to Portrait mode

Jim M. recommends Everest for IDing your hardware:<BR>

<P><BR>
*** This is one of those hardware inventory programs. Doesn't install. Just unzip and run which I like. It's 
certainly a fun program to try out. It caught my attention when it listed URLs for driver downloads for the
hardware you have in addition to telling you if 48 bit LBA is supported or not. 
<P>
I was told it polled hardware directly which is better than pulling data from windows. To test, I deleted
the ENUM branch in the registry on a win98SE pc and yes, it still got the correct video, sound, and 
motherboard data correct tho with less detail, but enough detail to make it worthwhile.  This app actually 
does both, ie poll directly and also use the data from windows, as some info was missing after I told 
windows I have no hardware :)
<P>
 I didn't have the guts to try the same type of test on an XP machine [grin]

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Spyware And XP User Accounts</font></STRONG>
<P>
Harvey G inquires - A friend has win xp home with 4 users, one of which is the administrator. If we run 
spyware removal programs (i.e., spybot, ad-aware), is it sufficient to only run it from the account which is 
the administrator? Or, do these programs need to be run in each individual accounts (i.e., does each 
account have its own registry, etc.)?
<P>
Mike responds:<BR>
It is necessary to run spyware/malware removers from EACH user account, to be sure that any registry 
entries placed in the specific user hives are removed -- yes, each account has it's own user portion of the
registry, or registry hive.
