Mohawk wrote - I'm buying a new computer. How much ram should I go for? I just do your average basic
stuff but I want to be prepared for the next version of Windows.
<P><BR>
*** 1 gig assuming you have the funds.  It's a nice touch to get the ram you'll need for the future rather than 
taking the chance later of encountering potential ram card/type/speed incompatibilities.  Also make sure 
you acquire at least a 7,200 RPM hard drive. 
<P>
Currently, a good data point is to see what Dell is offering in it's basic line of Desktops which is now 512 
megs. Then double that for what you are most likely to need a year or 2 from now.  As a reference, it was 
only a year or so ago when Dell was putting in 256 standard, while at that time you really should have
been installing 512 for XP if you were thinking about the future.

<P>
BK asked - I'm trying to move a WIN98/XP Pro dual boot, set up by XP Pro, to a larger Hard Drive. 
WIN 98 on C: FAT32, XP on D: NTFS.  I set up the new drive the same way (3 partitions) with XP and 
transferred the files booting from the floppy with the  copy partition Utilities supplied by WDigital. I put the 
new HD to Master and the tried Single (removing the old HD). I also tried the same setting up the 
partitions with the WDig software and transferring files again. I ran bootcfg /rebuild from recovery. When I 
try to boot with the new HD, all I get is WIN98. What am I missing. It seems all the relevant boot files are 
on the C drive.
<P>
Michael S. replies:<BR>
You need to image the complete drive with something like Drive Image/ BootIT NG, then connect the 
new drive [set as the master] as the primary master and the drive with the image somewhere else as a 
slave or secondary master/slave.
<P>
Image the drive, shut and disconnect old drive before rebooting. After system is running you can connect 
the old drive and format for additional storage.
<P>
BootIT NG from Terabyte:<BR>

Drive Image from Power Quest:<BR>

Alex N. adds:<BR>
You need a proper partition manager that will do an exact copy.  What I use is BootIT NG, from http://www.BootitNG.com ($35 shareware - 30 day full functional trial)
<P>
Download, to its own folder, extract from the zip, run the bootitng to make a boot floppy.
<P>
With the new drive plugged in as slave/secondary, boot the floppy, Cancel Install, entering maintenance, 
then click on Partition work.  Highlight your C:, Copy, then on left select  the new drive (HD1), highlight the 
Free Space in it, and Paste. 
<P>
Now click on 'View MBR' and in it highlight the entry for this new 'about to be C' partition  and click the 
'Set Active'  Click 'Write Standard MBR' and Apply.  
<P>
Close out, swap the disks to make the new one the one that boots, and reboot into XP.  The C will now be 
this copy on the other drive.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Idle Process At 98%</font></STRONG>
<P>
Lorin S. inquired - I've got the very annoying problem that my cpu consumes all the time between 40 and 
60 percent performance, but idle process is about 98%!
<P>
Max B. answers:<BR>
If it's the 40 - 60% performance, then you should only be concerned if it's like that ALL the time even when 
you are NOT using the computer (ie not typing, playing games, etc.)
<P>
If you're concerned about the 98% idle process dont be. All that is showing is that the CPU is idle 98% of 
the time (IOW it's NOT doing anything, it's waiting for you to get it to DO something) This is a good thing, 
not a bad thing.
<P><BR>
*** I'd amend what Max said right above to [currently 98% of the cpu is idle]. Off the bat tho Max is on track
and many folks get worried about the system idle report they see in diagnostics when they shouldn't be. 
In other words when your sitting there staring at the report and not doing anything else 98% of the cpu is
available for use and is currently idle which is perfectly logical.

<P>
Paul wrote - I have a Pentium-4 /3.40 GHZ ( hyperthreading) with 1.00GB of RAM running Windows-XP Professional that I use for Video editing.
<P>
I have 4 huge SATA hard drives installed (all of them NTFS file system), and just one of them shows as "Dynamic" in the Disk management console, the rest figures as "Basic".
<P>
Question: Should I convert the Basic disks to Dynamic, or the Dynamic one to basic? What is the best for 
handle large video files in Windows-XP?
<P>
Mike K. says:<BR>
Basic disks are probably your best bet.  Dynamic disks are really only useful if you plan to create a 
fault-tolerant disk set with RAID-5, striping or mirroring.

<P>
Rob questions - Is it better for computers in general to be left on all the time or put into standby mode vs 
being turn off? Which is better for the life of the computer? 
<P><BR>
*** That is such a common question and for many years past I'd suggest that it did not matter either way. 
However, these days I feel confident in suggesting that if you're not using the pc, shut it off for longest
life and minimal hassle down the road. 
<P>
We all know modern home computers run hotter and cooling is a prime issue. Running a pc 24/7 means
that it's sucking in dust 24/7 and that dust is accumulating on all your fans and heatsinks and within your
power supply. The more dust the hotter your computer runs. The hotter it runs the less life, in theory, it has. Standby wont shut off the fans nor should it. 
<P>
Joe offers:<BR>
I do not think it would make much difference. Most computer components with the exception of optical 
drives and power supplies if they work out of the box are going to work beyond the point the computer is outdated any way. 
<P>
However I vote to shut it down completely. Restarting seems to cure more glitches that occur over the 
course of using a computer than any thing else you can do so I say start fresh every time you use it within reason. Personal opinion if you are coming back to it within a hour leave it on beyond that shut it off.
<P><BR>
*** As an aside we're talking about home/office pcs, not the servers you find in clean non-carpeted rooms
that run your web domains etc.
