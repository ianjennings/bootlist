<STRONG><font color="red">1) The Ins And Outs Of System Restore</font></STRONG>
<P>
sneakemail asked - Can someone tell me the extent restore points can restore a system to? What exactly
gets restored? If I uninstalled MS Word using add/remove programs can I use restore points to recover 
the deleted files?
<P>
Ron M. responds:<BR>
No, [you cant use system restore to recover deleted files.]
<P>
See MVP Bert Kinney's System Restore pages:<BR>
<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~mvp_bert/index.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~mvp_bert/index.html</A>
<P>
Here are a couple of excerpts from those pages:
<P>
System Restore is a tool that allows you to roll the system back or restore it to a previous state in order 
to correct issues caused by the system becoming unstable. This utility should be used whenever you
suspect that the system is improperly configured, as the result of installing incompatible software or 
hardware or making inappropriate configuration changes.
<P>
System Restore monitors system changes and saves the system state as a restore point. If a system 
problem develops as a result of a system change, the user can return the system to a previous state 
using the data from a restore point.
<P>
Applications and the system can create restore points when system changes occur. System Restore 
also creates checkpoints every 24 hours of absolute time. It can also be configured to create restore 
points at regular intervals. In addition, users can create restore points at any time. 
<P>
System Restore does not restore user data or documents, so it will not cause users to lose their files, 
e-mail, browsing history, or favorites.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) C:\Program Files\Common Files</font></STRONG>
<P>
Will wrote - My "Common Files" folder at C:\Program Files\Common Files is over 350 MB. Can I delete it 
safely or do programs need it to be there?
<P>
Ron M. explains:<BR>
Unless you are *absolutely certain* that all of the applications which use these files have been uninstalled
from your computer it is not safe to remove them.
<P>
This folder contains application program related files that are, or can be, used by more than one 
application program.  So rather than have each application install its own copy of these files the 
"Common files" folder is used so that only a single copy is needed and that copy can be used "in 
common" by all of the applications that need it.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Make XP Show Both Date And Time</font></STRONG>
<P>
mmiller99 inquired - Is there a way to get XP professional to show the date next to the time in the lower 
right hand corner (bottom toolbar)?
<P>
Ken B. answered:<BR>
Expand the Task Bar to two (or more) lines high. Or use a  third-party program, such as the freeware 
TCLock.
<P>
Alex adds:<BR>
Right-click the taskbar and click 'Lock the Taskbar'. Then extend the taskbar upwards. You can now see 
the date and the clock together. Then right-click the taskbar and click 'Lock the Taskbar' again. Done!
<P><BR>
*** I do like TClock.   Here's a download site for the last, and possibly final version 1.2:<BR>
<P>
<A HREF="http://shii.org/tclock">http://shii.org/tclock</A>
<P>
If that site goes down or is busy I will always have TClock on my Utilities page. This is the IP for the time
server I've been using for years 64.236.96.53
<P>
Or, one can find an alternate time server and just enter in that IP in the TClock2 Properties | Synchronize | Server tab.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) My Game Needs 64 RAM To Run But I Have 512</font></STRONG>
<P>
Amy asks - My Dad just built this nice little pc for me to take back to college. Well now I'm here and want 
to play a game but it says it needs 64 megs of ram to run. The computer has 512 megs of ram so I'm at a
loss at what to do. Dad's back on a sub now for the Navy so I cant call him. 
<P><BR>
*** It's the video ram that your game is looking for. Your computer has an onboard video card and by
default many systems have it set to only share [allocate] 32 megs of the 512 for video. Go into your bios 
and look for the place to set it up to to 64. For example, on the computer that I'm fixing now, its in:
<P>
Advanced | AGP Bridge Configuration | Onboard Video Memory
<P>
Which allows me to change it to 16, 32, or 64. Other systems let you go even higher, but only set it for what
you need for the game as the more you use for video the less you have for windows. Your Dad was pretty
smart tho putting in at least 512 for a student system. 
<P>
Please note that different bios's will/may have the setting you are looking for labeled differently so just look 
around and you'll find it.  It's in there someplace.

<P>
FrizBOT phoned - Hi guy. I have a customer who runs a check cashing service who wants to make sure
his business pc as secure as possible. He "heard" that passwords may remain the the pagfile so he's 
looking for a way to clear that file on shutdown. Is there an easy way to do this without risking installing a
third party application? 
<P><BR>
*** Yes.
