<STRONG><font color="red">1) I Am Considering Updating To XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
forest asks - I am considering updating to xp. Please could someone advise me what will
happen to my modem and usb drivers currently on windows 98. Will the new os
replace them so i can use the internet and digital camera for example.
<P>
Thor says:<BR>
Whether there will be XP compatible drivers installed automatically depends on
the brand and model of modem. As for the USB, if it's on-board, chances are
that XP will have the appropriate drivers. XP's install process includes an
evaluation phase that will hopefully note any devices and applications that
might not function properly after the upgrade. I would advise you to check with
the modem manufacturer to see if there is an XP available for your modem,
should it be necessary to install one if you upgrade. External devices like
cameras, scanners printers, etc. may need updated drivers from their respective
manufacturers to work properly in XP. As for whether you should upgrade, that
depends. What kind of machine do you have? How old is it? What are the
specifications?
<P><BR>
*** It's a pretty safe bet that a computer that's been made since 1/1/2000 will run
XP just fine.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) AMD XP CPUs Compared To Older Anthons</font></STRONG>
<P>
sligo posts - What is difference between the XP model and other athlon processors?
<P>
Dom F answers:<BR>
It's the latest series. Significantly, it's the first AMD series to use
model numbers rather than clock speeds - the XP concentrates on IPC
(Instructions per cycle) rather than just clock speed - so they have a lower
clock speed but generally better performance than Intel P4's. The XP2200+
will be the last in the AthlonXP series using the Palomino core.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.amd.com/athlonxp">http://www.amd.com/athlonxp</A> for info.
<P>
Oxford Systems adds:<BR>
The Athlon XP has "data prefetch" which speeds up operations by decreasing
the amount of time the processor has to wait for instructions, has
"screaming sindy" SSE instruction (otherwise known as MMX) licensed from
Intel (so it is able to run faster in MMX optimized applications like
PhotoShop and Microsoft Media Encoder), has an improved L1/L2 cache lookup
buffer and uses a wee bit less power (therefore less heat) than the previous
"non-XP" generation of Athlons at the same clock speed.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Burned Video CDs Will Only Play On My PC</font></STRONG>
<P>
Eunice inquires - I have made lots of video cd's but find I can only play them on my computer.
I have taken them to a store that sells dvd players, and some of them say on the front ,,,,dvd and vcd,,,,
yet they will not play the ones I have made on my xp computer. They will play the DVD ones that I have made, but not the vcd ones.
<P>
Panaque suggests:<BR>
Just because a DVD player says in plays VCDs it does not mean that it will
play VCDs burnt onto CDRs. Check out <A HREF="http://www.vcdhelp.com/">http://www.vcdhelp.com/</A> for all you need to
know about making VCDs and which DVD players will play them.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) UMAX Scanner And XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
Marcia asks - I have a UMAX ASTRA 3400 scanner.  Before the installation process can be done, a message form microsoft is displayed saying that if the UMAX software is installed it may cause problems 
to my computer either now or in the future.  I have Windows XP operating system. The software apparently isn't digitally signed.  We got the scanner with our computer (Dell Dimension 4300) The options at that 
point are "install anyway" or "cancel installation".
<P>
Michael S. MS-MVP suggests:<BR>
Don't install the software and see if the scanner will function properly using the XP default drivers.  We've had a lot of problems with software bundles.  Often the hardware is compatible with XP and will work using the drivers that ship with XP but the software bundles cause problems due to compatibility issues.
<P><BR>
*** That's good advice for any perif., or for that matter for your video or modem card as well.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) How To Assign Drive Letters In XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
John asks - I removed my old burner, then rebooted.  It reassigned my drive letters and now many programs will not run or uninstall.  Is there a way to change the mappings back without having to blow 
away the drive?
<P>
Patty M. MS MVP suggests:<BR>
Right-click My Computer and choose Manage.  Click on the Disk Management entry in the left pane.  In a moment, it will bring up all your drives in the right-pane.  Right-click the drive you want and choose Change Drive letter and path.

<STRONG><font color="red">6) Dual Boot XP And Windows 2000 On New PC</font></STRONG>
<P>
jscooper22 asks - I'm planning on getting a new PC with XP Pro preinstalled. I'd like to add second drive [and] load win2000 on it to create a dual boot system. Maybe I'll just get a single giant drive and repartitian 
it into two, I'm not sure yet.  Can anyone give me any advice or point me anywhere that'll tell me what I need to know before I try this?
<P><BR>
*** I'd buy the second drive, and "temporarily" set it up as C: and then install Windows 2000 on it and make sure it's working. Then I'd play with hardware again and make it a Slave. I'd then use the BIOS to select
what drive [OS] I wanted to boot to that session. 
<P>
It's like having two computers in a way. Your OS's are completely separated. If a drive fails your PC can 
still function 100% without having to worry about boot managers and/or NT .ini files and such, [yes you 
may have to change hard drive jumper settings again if one drive does fail and you have to use the other, etc.] 
<P>
Note that this method is simply my opinion and the way I use my PC at home. There are many other
ways to configure multiple boot systems.

Spider asks - Are there any freebie programs to block the darned spammers? Getting really
annoying.

Charlie G. suggests:<BR>
Try bouncing back the spam like your email address is invalid. I
usually don't hear a second time from any spammer I bounced.Spam
Bouncer and Mail Washer are a couple of good ones:

<STRONG><font color="red">9) Why Install Older OS First For Dual Boot?</font></STRONG>
<P>
jscooper22 inquires - Can someone tell me why it's better to install an older OS first?  I plan on getting a 
new PC with XP Pro preinstalled then add a second drive and load it with Win2000.  If it's on a separate 
physical drive, shouldn't it leave the first (C:) drive alone during installation?
<P>
Harry O. replies:<BR>
Doug Knox has directions for doing what you wish at his site:<BR> 
<A HREF="http://www.dougknox.com/xp/tips/xp_repair_2k.htm">http://www.dougknox.com/xp/tips/xp_repair_2k.htm</A>
<P>
However you may be better off using a program like BootIt NG from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/">http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/</A>
as this app will enable you to boot either Hard Drive as well as partition drives, make backup images etc.

Sly also inquires - I am running XP Pro, and would like to install 98SE and have a dual boot option (my 
son has a couple of new games that wont run under XP/Voodoo 3. Any help or advice would be greatly 
appreciated.
<P>
Ken says:<BR>
Generally if you want to duel boot you would have win98 on first. Then you
would run setup from xp cd from within windows 98 and choose new
installation. Then it will automaticly setup duel boot for you.
<P>
Sly comes back:<BR>
Any way of doing it the other way around? I really didn't want to reformat.
<P>
Synapse Syndrome suggests:<BR>
Yes.  You can install Win98 afterwards if you use PartitionMagic to make
another partition at the beginning of your drive. Then use the bundled
BootMagic software to switch between OSs.  I've done this, and it works
perfectly.
<P><BR>
Jon & Fran Hawton pops in - I have a NTFS partition that is at the front. Can I put 98 or Me on one of
my other partitions since it is not at the front??
<P><BR>
*** NT IT Pros often suggest a "front" fat16 aka fat partition. This allows you the freedom to do what you have to do.
