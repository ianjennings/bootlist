<P>
Every once in a while I find a Windows XP tech site that I'm proud to recommend. No hoops to jump 
through to get the info you want. Nice, easy to understand tutorials which include fast graphics. And an
index that actually works!
<P>
The Elder Geek On Windows XP:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.theeldergeek.com/">http://www.theeldergeek.com/</A>
<P>
I asked the Elder Geek himself to share with us a little history of his site:
<P>
"A few years back the computer system crashed in the emergency room where I worked. Unable to 
reach IT, one of the nurses said, "Where the hell are all those geeks?" Another one looked at me and 
said, "I don't know where they are, but we've got the elder geek here." A few weeks later I had a blowout
with a useless supervisor, got fired, and the next day The Elder Geek on Windows XP was born. Best 
thing in the world that ever happened to me."

<STRONG><font color="red">2) How To Stop Messenger Running When Opening OE</font></STRONG>
<P>
JethroUK asks - How to stop messenger running in background when I open o/express?
<P>
Frank S. explains:<BR>
Turn off the Contacts pane.
<P>
From  <A HREF="http://www.fjsmjs.com/OE/disabmes.htm">http://www.fjsmjs.com/OE/disabmes.htm</A>
<P>
To prevent MS Messenger from loading with OE you must do BOTH of these things if you don't want to 
edit the Registry:
<P>
In Tools | Options uncheck the option to automatically logon to Messenger.<BR>
AND<BR>
In View | Layout uncheck the Contacts Pane.<BR>
OR<BR>
Go to Start | Run and type Regedit
<P>
Go to:<BR>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Outlook Express<BR>
Add a New, DWORD value called Hide Messenger and set the value to 2. (This step is required to 
prevent a long delay when opening OE with the Contacts pane enabled)
<P>
To just stop it from running at all follow this advice from Kelly:<BR>
Only 3 Registry edits are required to stop Messenger and get rid of the delay in OE.  
Start | Run | Regedit<BR>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Messenger\Client
<P>
Add the following values as New, DWord Values:<BR>
PreventRun<BR>
PreventAutoRun<BR>
Set the value of each of these to 1
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Outlook Express
<P>
Add a New, DWORD value called Hide Messenger and set the value to 2. (This step is required to 
prevent a long delay when opening OE with the Contacts pane enabled)
<P>
You can also stop the spam without disabling Messenger.  In Messenger select Tools | Options and 
open the Privacy tab.  In MSN Messenger 5 there a check box Only people on My Allow List can see my 
status and send me messages that you can check (turn on).  In Windows Messenger 4.7 you can select 
the All other users in My Allow List and move it to My Block List.  In both cases the popups should stop 
and you can still IM with your friends.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Apps In Add/Remove Disappeared</font></STRONG>
<P>
V Green writes - Sometime over the last two days, about 2/3 of the items in my Add/Remove Programs 
list have disappeared.
<P>
I can still see the entire list using Everest, and uninstall from there, but this makes me REALLY edgy and wondering what the heck happened.
<P>
Richard U responds:<BR>
There are some program installs that place a large, blank area in the add/remove list. Scroll down to the 
end of the list [and past the blank area]. See if your other programs are [down] there.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Slow CD Burning On New Dell</font></STRONG>
<P>
Jacob questions - A month ago I bought a new DELL computer with 3.0 GHz Pentium 4,800 bus, 512 MB memory.  I tried both HP 9700 CD burner with 16x speed, and IOMagic 8x dual DVD burner rated at 40x for 
CD reading and burning.  In both cases I could not get more than 7.5x CD copying speed.
<P>
I'm using Windows XP Pro, Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.  I tried three different brands of blank CDs rated 
at 48x, all with the same result. IDE controller for IOMagic showed Transfer mode: DMA if available,
and Current Transfer Mode: PIO mode.
<P>
Bob K. suggests:<BR>
My guess is that your IDE controller is stuck in PIO mode. There are a variety of fixes here:
<P>
IDE ATA and ATAPI Disks Use PIO Mode After Multiple Time-Out or CRC Errors
Occur:
<P>
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=817472">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=817472</A>
<P>
The simplest method is to uninstall the IDE controller from Device Manager and let XP re-install it.
<P>
Nelson L. adds:<BR>
Need to get it out of PIO mode and into DMA mode to get faster performance. Try going into the BIOS 
and checking the settings of the device attached to the secondary master.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Referencing The Defragging Of The Pagefile</font></STRONG>
<P>
I always check the pagefile of systems I get in the shop - many are severely fragmented.  You cannot 
effectively defragment the pagefile, though products such as Diskeeper make a good run at it.  In cases 
where the pagefile is broken into more than 5 or 6 fragments I do the following:
<P>
Reset the pagefile size to the minimum allowed (usually 2MB) and reboot the system, then set the size 
back to its original or the desired size and reboot again.
<P>
The pagefile is not reset to default on each boot, that is recreated clean.  It is cleared, but it simply clears 
the data and does not remap it.  Find a machine with a severely fragmented pagefile and run a pagefile 
mapper, you can even use Diskeeper for this, and you will see that it is in as miserable shape as it was 
before.
<P>
All that aside, this is not usually necessary is a PC with adequate memory, however, most off the shelf 
lower end boxes (Dell, Gateway, Compaq) come with a whopping 128MB of RAM.  It is technically 
feasible to run XP on 64MB, but it is not useable.
