<STRONG><font color="red">1) Fresh XP Install On A SATA Hard Drive</font></STRONG>
<P>
Gary R asked - Putting together a new system, I figured I might as well get SATA drives (wont be using 
RAID), but a quick search shows a lot of problems installing XP.  It doesn't recognize the drive when 
booting from the CD, needs drivers via floppy, drive disappears later, etc...
<P>
Is this to be expected if I get the SATA drives?  It will be a clean install on a new drive.  Will I need to slap 
in a floppy drive to install drivers before I can install XP?   And is this one of those things that's likely to be 
a source of problems?  (if so, it's not worth it to me, I'll stick with IDE).
<P>
Karl B answered:<BR>
I have done it several times with no problems.  You just have to F6 the initial installation to load the RAID 
drivers for the on board SATA.  Even though it is not RAID per se, it still runs on a RAID channel, so you 
have to install the drivers before you install the O/S.
<P>
RonK said:<BR>
You will need the floppy drive to install the Sata drivers during the install. At the first part of the install you 
will be prompted to hit the F6 key to install the Sata drivers. You will have to extract the drivers from the motherboard driver disk onto a floppy.
<P>
You should not have any of the other problems you asked about. The sata drives will be fine after the installation.
<P>
Jerry adds:<BR>
The main, and probably only, issue will be the requirement to install the SATA drivers from the floppy 
when XP asks for it during initial setup.

<P>
debrah posted - My laptop disabled the standby feature (it was available now it's not).  I checked power management and cannot get it to be enabled.  Has this happened to anyone else?  How do I fix this? 
<P>
DJ B. answered:<BR>
This is usually the result of improperly loaded video drivers.  Check that your video driver is properly 
installed and if not, or if it's incorrectly identified, reinstall the proper driver.  You should be able to 
download the driver from your laptop manufacturer's webpage.
<P><BR>
*** Often people have standby problems when they upgrade their OS which again, is often a result of not
having the [proper ] video drivers installed for the OS you just upgraded to.  Also, if standby is locking, 
not waking up, displaying white screens, etc it generally has to do with the video drivers.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Large AVI Causes Explorer To Use 100% CPU</font></STRONG>
<P>
MrZULU inquired - When I click on a large AVI file Explorer seems to hang up and use 100% of the CPU.
This doesn't happen with other large video files only AVIs. Is there a fix? I am using Windows XP.
<P><BR>
*** There are two fixes. The first one requires that you have SP1 installed and then put in a call to Microsoft
for the special [hotfix] download. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=822430">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=822430</A>
<P>
The second way is to download and install the SP2 Upgrade.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Ghost Clone Failed On 2 Different PCs</font></STRONG>
<P>
Robert asked - 
I bought a copy of Norton Ghost 2003 to Clone drive C on my two computers. I have Windows XP on one 
and windows XP Pro on the other.  I find that after I Ghost the C drive to the slave on either computer and 
change the slave to master and attach it to the master ribbon it will not boot up. [I used to do this all the
time in Windows 98 and never had a problem.]
<P><BR>
*** Did you clone using a ghost boot floppy and do the disk to disk clone?
<P>
Or, if you did, and restarted the pc right after you ghosted it often messes up the clone you just made. 
<P>
Or, assuming you now have only one hard drive in, ie the clone, is the pc still looking for the old drive in the bios?  If you're using cable select and 80 conductor cables are you moving the slave to the end of the 
cable?  If you're not using cable select are you resetting the jumper on the slave to master/single? 
<P>
Your question is asked a lot, even by new techs who've used ghost in dos/win98 often have a niggle in 
XP. The procedure is explained in the docs of course but ..... Anyway, the mistake most folks make when 
doing disk to disk clones in XP with Ghost is that the first thing they do is check that the data was copied correctly. When you clone, you end up with 2 Primary Active Drives which on a reboot can immediately 
damage the clone. Not the hardware of course it's a software thing.
<P>
In other words, after you do a disk to disk copy using Ghost shut the pc off, and then connect the clone
as C: and reboot.  Note this method of using Ghost is employed when you want to replace your old hard 
drive with a newer, larger hard drive.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) How To Clear Recent Docs In XP</font></STRONG>
<P>
Frank wrote - How do you clear the list of "My recent Documents" in XP? In prior versions of Windows this 
was easy to do.
<P>
ByTor responded:<BR>
Go to your control panel.
<P>
Open "taskbar and start menu" click the "start menu" tab.
<P>
If "start menu" is ticked hit the customize button, click "Advanced" tab, at the bottom you will see a "clear 
list" button.
<P>
If "classic start menu" is ticked hit the customize button and just click the "clear" button.
