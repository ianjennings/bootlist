<P>
Betsy Sue asks - Hi. I love to fix old computers to help my neighbors out and I think it's real cool that you 
write about Windows XP problems and hardware problems that any fix-it-person may encounter. I am a 
long time reader of your newsletter and I remember you writing about com port addresses and resources.
You had a nice list but I cant seem to find it. I must have left it in one of my neighbors trailers. 
<P>
When I mean old I mean real old like Windows 95 computers with 16 megs of RAM. 
<P><BR>
*** That was back in December 2002. Guess it's a good time to repost the list.
<P>
COM1 3F8 IRQ4<BR>
COM2 2F8 IRQ3<BR>
COM3 3E8 IRQ4<BR>
COM4 2E8 IRQ3
<P>
This list was actually the first page in my data book for many years. It was invaluable when you had to
set up addresses and resources on old controller cards and/or modems using the jumpers.
<P>
ps Remember when Device Manager actually was a device manager and let you choose your settings
to resolve resource problems? [grin]

When you run a website such as mine you tend to get turned on to some new, off the beaten path, links. 
Here's one of them. It has some pretty interesting education and business apps. [Thanks Vic]

Here's one one called Low-Trans Fat and Low-Carb Diet for Your PC or How to optimize Windows XP for 
the best performance.  Lots of graphics but the advice surely fits the title.    [Thanks UTF]

Old Bob asks - When I look in my add/remove programs section, the Last used dates of most programs 
are not current-not even close.  Is there a setting I need to change?
<P>
Wesley V. says:<BR>
This seems to be a worthless function.  Along with frequency of use. Nothing you can do but to ignore this.

bcampbell writes - Is it possible to use an autoexec.bat file in winXP Pro to delete all files with a specified 
file extension during startup?
<P>
anon suggests:<BR>
[Best bet is to] create a batch file to delete what you want and put it in the startup folder.

Ric writes - I got infected by a virus and used system restore to get the machine running again. I've 
cleaned up the virus, but it still exists within the restore point. Is there any way to delete the restore point?
<P>
Carey F. answers:<BR>
One cannot selectively delete restore points.  When you turnoff System Restore, all restore points will be deleted. This is the only way to remove any virus files that have infected System Restore files.

kevinc asks - I have a laptop with XP Home Edition English version and need to change it to Spanish. 
What are the steps. HP says I need a CD from Microsoft because XP does not have Spanish built in.
<P>
Bruce C. answers:<BR>
HP's correct.
<P>
You cannot upgrade or convert from one language version of the OS to another, so you'll have to 
purchase and use the full version of Spanish WinXP to perform a clean installation.

option to disable scandisk at startup. Is there a way to do the same in XP?

<P>
GabrielG writes - I just bought a S video cable for my laptop and is connected to my TV but it's not working at all. Am  missing something else ? What Do I have to do to view my Laptop screen to my TV ?
<P>
Brad G. answers:<BR>
Usually you have to turn on the S-Video when you hook something up to it. Most laptops I've seen use a keystroke such as Fn-F6 to do this.  If your Fn key is purple then you should see a little purple tv icon on one of your keys (it's F6 on mine).
<P>
Another possibility might be to go to Control Panel -> Display and check on the Settings tab.  You might 
be able to enable it through there.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Used Laptop Advice</font></STRONG>
<P>
Buffy inquires - Could someone recommend a good source to purchase one of these? Second not being 
able to splash on a new one could someone tell me whether say a Pentium 3 with 256 Ram would 
effectively run WinXP?
<P>
UTF replies:<BR>
Factor in the cost of a replacement battery (which can be very expensive) when buying a secondhand 
laptop. Many have batteries that will run for a few minutes at most [which is often one reason folks are
selling them from my experience].
<P>
Presumably *just* running XP isn't the issue - it is whether it will give acceptable performance running your intended applications. In which case, saying what you intent to use the laptop for would be useful!
<P>
Bear in mind also that you may find that the laptop is not fully functional using XP, an operating system it 
was not designed for - the PC card may not work, the graphics adapter may only work in a basic way, the 
fax-modem may not work at all, etc. I have three laptops here that suffer from this, even though XP 
appears to run ok at first glance. 
<P>
You need to research this thoroughly, once you know which make/model you intend to buy.
<P><BR>
*** I tend to agree with UTF. Laptop makers often dont, or cant update drivers like they do in desktops. 
The hardware is way more proprietary and laptops are primarily designed to run the OS they came with
new.  Of course there are exceptions, as always, to any general statement, even tho it's based on lots of
personal experience. 
<P>
Another thing to watch out for is dead pixels on the screen.  One or two may not seem to matter at first but
they can really get to annoy you after a while. And, you may not even see them until you start using your
favorite app.  
<P>
Then there are worn out tracking buttons, system passwords that have to be professionally removed by
an authorized dealer, and worn out AC/battery charging hardware. So if  you're buying online make sure
in your agreement you demand that all these things work to cover yourself in case you have to cancel the
credit card charge.

<P>
spike writes - Whenever I try to use checkdisk my computer restarts and I receive the message:
<P>
[volume is ntfs cannot open volume for direct access]  And checkdisk doesn't run . Any  ideas? 
<P>
Richard replies:<BR>
If this is the first time you have run CHKDSK since installing Zone Alarm 5 that is where your problem 
comes from. Go to the FAQs at the ZA site and follow the instructions to uninstall ZA5 and replace with 
ZA 4.5. There are other possible causes but ZA5 is flavour of the month.
<P>
Alex N. adds:<BR>
It only arises when something goes wrong so that CHKDSK gets set to run at Startup.  At that point the 
trouble with ZA kicks in.  You need to go back to the earlier ZA, then the CHKDSK will get in to do its stuff.
<P><BR>
*** Zone Alarm is starting to get a little to bloated for my taste. It's already about twice the size of other
firewalls.
