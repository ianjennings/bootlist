<P>
Mr. Washington asks - I am having problems installing a floppy disk drive. After I connect up the cable 
and the power source and boot up the computer the indicator light on the floppy disk just stays on 
continuously. The is no sign of the drive in my computer. What could I be doing wrong?
<P><BR>
*** The data cable is installed backwards. Or, you're putting it on a tad ajar and missing connecting
two pins on either side of the cable.  Note that 90% of the time pin one for the data cable is next to the 
power supply connector. 
<P>
Also make sure it's set to a 1.44 in your bios as sometimes the cmos resets itself to NONE, which makes
sense actually if you originally connected it incorrectly.

Regshot? It might be good enough for the job, and it's free instead of $40.

<P>
pookster inquires - When I try to log onto [some webpages including my hotmail] its telling me its a 
secure site and wont load it.  How can I make it load this [and other secure] site(s)? 
<P>
Taurarian delineates:
<P>
In Internet Explorer <BR>
1. Tools | Internet Options | Advanced<BR>
2. Scroll down to the Security Settings<BR>
3. Make sure that the two boxes are checked that say "Enable SSL 2" or "Enable SSL 3" [Now] try your 
secure sites.
<P>
Another thing you can try is:<BR>
Go to start/run<BR>
Type in: regsvr32 softpub.dll<BR>
Press Enter or click OK

How to troubleshoot problems accessing secure Web pages with IE6 SP2 After you upgrade to 
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2).  In Microsoft Windows XP SP2, some SSL-secured 
(128-Bit) Web pages and Web sites may not work correctly. Frequently, this behavior is caused by 
security changes in Windows XP SP2.

kbyang asks -  Each time I startup my computer I am getting this window popup error "The System has recovered from a serious error."  A log has been created. Please tell microsoft about it.
<P>
Well it's been going on for a about a week now. How do I fix it?  How do I get rid of this?
<P>
Patti M. replies:<BR>
See if the information in this MSKB article, "You receive a 'System Has Recovered from a Serious Error' message after every restart", helps resolve the problem:

<P>
PapaBear complains - Can anyone help me in removing service pack 2, as it is slowing down some 
applications. The service pack came already installed on the machine [I just bought] and if you go into add/remove programs it is not in there to remove.
<P>
Bruce C. says:<BR>
If Service Pack 2 was provided pre-installed when you purchased the computer, there's no way to 
uninstall it short of formatting the hard drive and performing a clean installation of the OS, using an 
installation CD that does not have SP2 slip-streamed in to its files.
