<P>
Ian inquired - I have 512 Megs of Ram on a single stick. I want 1 gig of Ram at least. Do I buy a 512  or a 1 gig module from a retail 
store to add to my system so I will have at least 1 gig or 1.5 gig?  If I wanted to settle on 1 gig I heard that it is best to have a single
stick to minimize any compatibility problem. 
<P><BR>
*** Good question. There are so many types of ram out now and you are taking a chance driving to a store and buying what's on the
shelf as you dont really know if it will be compatible or not. I suggest buying from a professional memory supplier that "knows" what
brands and upgrades are best for your specific motherboard.
<P>
For example, tho my sons pc docs said his mobo can take 1 gig modules both Crucial and 18004memory.com suggested 512
stick upgrades to get the total he needed.  I took Crucial's advice and bought 2, 512 meg cards, put them in the 2nd and 3rd slots
and it worked perfectly. Now he has 1.5 gig of Ram.

"System Restore is not able to protect your computer. Please restart your computer, and then run System Restore again."

So I've restarted and tried again and I still get the same message.

<P>
JohnSmith1 asked - When I want to upgrade from home to pro.  It comes with a message "current OS is newer than you are trying to install" and does not upgrade. What I can do apart from formatting everything and installing XP Pro.
<P>
Ken B. said:<BR>
You have SP2 installed, and your XP Professional Upgrade is without it, so it is an older version than what's installed. You have two choices:
<P>
1. Uninstall SP2, do the upgrade, then reinstall SP2.<BR>
2. Create a slipstreamed version of XP Professional, including SP2, and use it. See:

<P>
I recommend the second choice.
<P>
Bruce C. said:
<P>
This means that your installed OS is at a higher service pack level than is the WinXP Pro CD you're using.  You'll either need to 
uninstall SP2 before attempting the upgrade, or try slipstreaming SP2 into the upgrade.

<P>
Dennis posted -  I have a WinXP system running on a 250gig ATA 100 drive.  I got a new SATA II 250gig drive today. I need more storage.  I'm trying to decide if I should reinstall WinXP onto the SATA drive and start from scratch (a lot of work). or just throw the 
SATA drive in the comp and leave XP running on the ATA.
<P>
But how much faster is it? 5%? or like 50%? Is it worth the effort reinstalling XP? Can anyone give me a some facts or point me to 
some straight forward links as to how much of a speed difference I would see?
<P><BR>
*** Easy answer. You wont see much of a difference so it's NOT really worth the effort. 
<P>
Dennis posts back:<BR>
I ended up switching XP to the SATA drive and starting fresh. As expected there is very little improvement that is "noticeable". Even in
benchmarks, of which I've run several kinds. The main improvement is in 'burst speed' which averages around 80mb/sec on my 
ATA 100 drive. On my new SATA II drive it is around 130mb/sec.  Also the ATA drive has a seek time of approx 15ms and on the 
SATA II drive is about 13ms.
<P>
As for the kind of info I was looking for, after I was done and it was too late I found that Tom's Hardware has a new hard drive 
comparison tool that is very very useful:
