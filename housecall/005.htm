You must use a command line to adjust the maximum space allocated for System Restore. See the following website for complete instructions.

Emmanuel D. wrote - I have a Satellite A65 series laptop computer with 256MB of ram pre-installed and I added 512MB to the available slot making for a total of
768MB of ram. Now 64MB of ram is reserved of the integrated video card.  Is there a way to adjust the reserved amount to 128MB instead of just 64MB for the integrated video card?
<P><BR>***
Only if you bios allows it. Many/most bios's with integrated video have setting where you may allocate how much of the onboard ram you want for video.

meteore posted - I just installed Vista, [on account of a messed up system restore], which caused nothing to work. I would like to reinstall Windows XP and remove Vista. Can someone outline the steps in a organized fashion. [I'd like to run both Vista and XP]

It's best to dual boot by installing the oldest OS first-XP-but you can get a dual boot done with Vista already installed.  You have a better chance of things working well that way but here is a way to dual boot:

If you really just want to go back to Windows XP. boot from the XP CD, during setup, you have the option to delete, create and format partitions.  Delete the Vista partition, create a new partition to replace it, format and setup XP on the new partition by continuing with XP setup, just follow the prompts.

<P>
Alice wrote - My boss said that I should submit our companies website to search engines. Is there a service I should use?
<P><BR>***
Modern search engines dont rely on submissions anymore, they have software which looks for keywords and links and then ranks your site according to content and other sites that link to your site. So, in other words, dont waste your money by paying some firm to list you in search engines. 
<P>
Rick M. begs to differ:<BR>
They do not 'rely' upon submissions, nor use them to rank, but submitted sites may be scanned (and hence ranked) sooner than their spider would discover the new or revised site.
