Wonderman wrote - I've been using Norton Password Manager for years and come to discover it isn't Vista compatible.  I tried the successor - Norton Confidential - and 
found it clumsy to install and it adds a nasty additional bar to IE7.  Much appreciate any thoughts on cheap / free vista compatible password software.

Try RoboForm.  I have used it on all my computers for years.

I'm a day late, and a dollar short. But there's nothing iffy about KeePass. It's Open Source, and very solid.

<STRONG><font color="red">2) Too Many USB Devices?</font></STRONG>
<P>
Dave questioned - I have a problem with a "keyboard error" screen that appears ever so often. I can get around the problem by connecting a PS2 keyboard and re-booting, then the computer will complete booting into Windows XP.
<P>
I have several things connected to USB ports:<BR>
Keyboard, Logitech G11<BR>
Two Mice<BR>
Printer<BR>
Two flash drives
<P>
I was thinking that I may have too many things connected to USB drives.  
<P><BR>
*** Most likely. Although many PCs these days have 6 USB ports, the number of devices you have connected may overwhelm the USB Bus on your motherboard. You may need to invest in a USB powered HUB. Also, always keep a ps/2 keyboard handy as you never know when you'll need one. 
<P>
Dave came back:<BR>
After I removed one of the USB mice, a wireless one, and removed one of the flash drives, and connected the keyboard into a USB slot on the computer itself
rather than the monitor, things seem to be back to normal.

<STRONG><font color="red">3) Is 512 RAM Enough For Vista?</font></STRONG>
<P>
3ONE9 asked - I am getting a new computer soon because my old one basically died on me. I am low on money but I've seen a good emachines I can afford and it's similar to one of the one's I had before and it works well. All the requirements are right and it comes with Windows Home Basic. The RAM is only 512MB and I plan 
on adding 1gb to that. But I wont be able to do it right when I get the computer. I was wondering if it is really as terrible and as slow as some people say with only 512MB?
<P>
zj responded:<BR>
As I know, thinkpad (IBM laptop) with 512 m ram can run vista home basic without problem.
<P><BR>
*** Yes it will run it just fine, just slow. 
<P>
Tony also asked - I also have a problem in my new laptop with Vista Business loaded which shows that in my total of 1G RAM it occupies 650MB with out even running any application. When I start any application it boots up to 800MB and not making me to work on my CAD application.
<P>
Why it is so? I have a low end Desktop with 1.6GHz. processor and 512MB RAM with Win XP and it works fine with all my application. Can any body advise me how to improve my notebook performance? 
<P><BR>
*** You need more RAM, 1 gig minimum, 2 gig recommended for Vista.  Keep in mind in you have an on board video controller, like most laptops, that the video "card" will suck up ram as well. Real RAM is always better then using the swap/page file. 
<P>
PcEngWork buds in:<BR>
It ( memory usage ) may not be a problem, but a normal operating condition for Vista. My desktop running XP pro uses around 300 Megabytes of RAM. My notebook uses ~760 Megabytes of the 1.5 Gigabytes available.  There are far more internal services that run under Vista than XP.
<P>
Vista is designed to utilize RAM in a different way from XP. Vista assumes/needs more RAM to simply run but internally handles the loading between System services and user's applications. Some IT specialist use the phrase "Unused RAM is wasted RAM".
<P>
You can get a better idea of memory usage and other Vista operating parameters by using the Resource Monitor.
<P>
The differences between XP and Vista's internal memory handling shouldn't really be a direct comparison. You can however reduce the memory loading by changing a few services that Vista starts up automatically that may not be 100% necessary.
<P>
Even with that don't expect to see Vista's memory footprint drop much below 500 Megabytes.
<P>
Huff adds:<BR>
What you are all failing to consider is the graphics cards in the three machines that do work. Back to the original question about 512 RAM it depends on what graphics card you have included with that package. If it is a dedicated card than you should be fine. If it isn't I would not recommend that purchase. However Windows vista does have a feature called ready boost in which you can substitute a jump drive for RAM as long as it is plugged in. I suggest if you must buy this machine then get yourself a readyboost capable jump drive to provide a temporary shortcut till you can upgrade your RAM.
<P><BR>
*** True, your graphics card may use some of the on board ram for itself, perhaps 64 to 128 megs. Which of course, leaves Vista with less ram to actually work with without using the page file.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) Vista Temp Files</font></STRONG>
<P>
JerryH questioned - Probably a simple question.  Would anyone know if I can delete the files that are in my "temp" folder, under Windows in my Windows Explorer?  These are different files that are "temp" when I go to my "Tools" button that is at the top of my Internet Explorer (right hand side of page).  When at the Tools in I.E. I can delete some temp. files there but that has no affect on the files in the "temp" that is listed under Windows in my Windows Explorer.  Okay to delete them all?  I have over 6 MB of stuff there.
<P>
Richard U. responded:<BR>
Temporary files are stored in various places and they must be deleted using different methods. The best way to delete the temporary internet files is through I.E. properties. There you can delete all temp files associated with internet explorer.
<P>
You can delete the files from other temp folders by browsing to the folders, selecting and then deleting the files. OR, you could use something like CCleaner (free) that will do all the above for you in one shot.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ccleaner.com/">http://www.ccleaner.com/</A>
<P>
dean-dean said:<BR>
You can also go to Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\System Tools, and use Disk Cleanup to remove the Temporary files.  According to Disk Cleanup's dialog, "You can safely delete temp files that have not been modified in over a week".
<P>
Jim said:<BR>
Yes.  The operating system will not allow deletion of files in use; hence succeeding in deleting a temp file causes no harm.  The program which created the temp file is supposed to delete them, but some of the programs don't follow this principle.
<P>
Steve E. said:<BR>
Normally right after a reboot "anything" in Temp is safe to delete.
<P>
Ken B. said:<BR>
The only temp files that are not safe to delete are those that are open and in use. But since Windows wont let you delete an open file, it's safe to (try to) delete them all.

<STRONG><font color="red">5) Product Key And Activation</font></STRONG>
<P>
Lamb C. posted - I just migrated from 2k to vista.  I have heard a lot rumors about product key and activation etc. Is there a way to find out the product key of my vista computer if I lost it? Any also how to get a copy of the activation key so that when I format the hard disk, I can reactivate again without any hassle?
<P>
Kerry B. answered:<BR>
The product key will be included with your copy of Vista. Write it down and store it somewhere safe. make a couple of copies and store them in different places. If you are re installing Vista to the same computer you can activate as many times as you want. After the first time you may have to phone for activation but as long as you are within the terms of the license it will be activated.
<P>
Bendover said:<BR>
Since you implied that you still have the key, write it down and store it somewhere safe.  I am assuming you still have the DVD with Vista on it. Write the key on the DVD case and keep that in a safe place.  You should always make sure to have all you disks when you need to do a restore. Remember, it isn't IF your hard drive will fail, it's WHEN.  Hopefully you will be prepared when that time comes.
<P>
pvdg42 adds:<BR>
Assuming you have Vista running (and inferring that you may have lost the key?), download and install the Belarc Advisor here:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</A>
<P>
It will show you a lot of valuable information about your computer, including the installation keys for your OS and other software. As Bendover said, make several printed copies of the report and store them in safe places.
