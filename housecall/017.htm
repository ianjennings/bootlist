someone wrote - I have the WXP Pro. edition and I am asking two questions. Firstly, the Floppy Disk drive had deleted itself from my computer and I am unable to 
enable this function. I have recently re-installed this WXP Pro. edition twice with the updates from the Microsoft Windows Update website. And, still I have no A drive.

If you believe it's been compromised then flatten it and rebuild.  See this link:<BR>

the screen has indicted "Setup will complete in approximantly 33 minutes" and stayed there for some 40 minutes.

<STRONG><font color="red">6) System Idle Takes 95% Of My CPU</font></STRONG>
<P>
Jeff G. inquired - Task manager shows me that of the many applications running on my XP machine the only one using significant CPU resources is "System Idle Process" taking 95 CPUs. Anyone know what the units are? Is there a way to discover what this process is doing, or is a case of shutting it down to see what crashes?
<P>
Frank S. said:<BR>
It isn't doing anything.  It's a record of how much of the time the CPU is idle.
<P>
pam120 adds:<BR>
The CPU column displays the percentage of CPU usage for the process listed under Image Name. The System Idle Process displays the CPU "power" that is waiting to be used, thus, it is "idle", waiting for something to do.
<P>
Bruce C. buds in:<BR>
Break out a dictionary and look up the word "idle," sometime.  ;-} The "System Idle Process" metric is the amount/percentage of time that your CPU has *nothing* to do.  A reading of 98-99% is generally considered a good thing, and readings above 90% are normal. Think of it like a car's engine idling in your driveway before you place the car in gear.
<P>
Ken B. wrote:<BR>
"System Idle Process" is not any problem at all. That's just the name for what the system is doing when it's not doing anything. It's there to make the total add up to 100%.
