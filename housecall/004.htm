1. Ignore the fact that it comes via AOL, it's the most useful thing they've have done. Ever.<BR>
2. Resist the offer of a toolbar during installation, it will simply nag you to spend money for something or another.

It blocks entries into your registry without your ok. No real resources taken up and you never know it's running until it's needed, then it scares the heck out of you :)
I always run it and just yesterday I accessed a web page that wanted to put something in my startup - ya it startled me.

benn686 asked - I paid for
" [1024MB X2] DDR2-800 PC6400 Memory Module Corsair-Value or Major Brand "
<P>
but what CPU-Z shows:
<P>
Slot 1<BR>
Mushkin DDR2 400 Mhz PC2-6400 1024MBytes correction none EPP no
<BR>
Slot 2<BR>
Mushkin DDR2 400 Mhz PC2-6400 1024MBytes correction none EPP no
<P>
Now to the lamen (thats me), I read "DDR2-800" to mean 800 Mhz, but I'm only getting 400 Mhz.  Is this the right nomenclature?
<P>
Noozer answered:<BR>
DDR2 400Mhz = DDR 2 800, because DDR double the clock rate.

<P>
CreloX posted - Is there a way in Windows Vista Home Premium I can assign a fixed drive letter to a specific drive? I have an external hard disc to sync my data as a back-up but the drive letter it gets depends on when it is plugged in and what other drives are plugged in at that moment. Since SyncToy needs a specific path to sync my data, I need my external disc to always be "G:" (otherwise SyncToy tries to put 3Gb of data on my 128Mb USB memory stick).
<P>
Neil H. said:<BR>
Right click 'Computer' and select 'Manage'. Under 'Storage' select 'Disk Management' Right click the volume and select 'Change Drive letter and paths' Choose the drive letter you want to assign. I did this for an external USB drive and the drive letter I assigned it 
sticks okay.
<P>
John B. added:<BR>
Go into Computer Management and Disk Management and assign a drive letter. I have 3 temporary devices I use and this has worked.  If I remember, I had to do it several times for one of them before it stuck.

flamemoth asked - Can anybody recommend a free / cheap alternative to the Backup and Restore Center, that works more like the NTBackup from previous versions?  All I want is to be able to select the folders to backup and save these selections for future backups.
<P>
Ray R. answered:<BR>
For free, try Cobian Backup:
