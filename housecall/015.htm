<STRONG><font color="red">1) My New Vista PC Wont Sleep</font></STRONG>
<P>
John W. emailed - I discovered that a new HP computer with Vista Home Premium installed would not Sleep, but always restarted. Eventually I tracked this down to the LAN port being enabled to wake the computer in the properties of the port. The LAN port was connected to an ADSL modem / router, which was randomly sending the LAN port a wake up call. Just disabling this solved the problem. Hope this is useful.
<P><BR>
*** Thanks, that a very common problem. I answer that type or similar type question many times in the forums I participate in. Most of the time the problem is solved in the bios by turning off "Wake on Lan" or "Wake on modem" setting, which in each bios, is often a little bit hard to find, but most often the setting _is_ there in one of the screens. 
<P>
In another example, lets say you have a plain dial up regular modem connected to the same telephone line as you get regular voice telephone calls on. Your PC can be totally shut off but boot up when you receive a phone call. In that example just turn off "wake on modem" or similar lingo in the BIOS or SETUP.  Note that modern PCs are always on unless you turn off the switch if you have one on the back of the power supply or turn off the surge protector or power strip. 
<P>
As a side note, that's why its really important to pull the power plug out from the back of your pc when adding cards or ram as there is power going to the motherboard unless you pull the plug.

<STRONG><font color="red">4) MS Malware Programs Question</font></STRONG>
<P>
programmernovice asked - I use both MS "Malicious Software Removal Tool"  and "Windows Defender".  What's the difference between them?  Are they both necessary?
<P>
Malke answered:<BR>
The Malicious Software Removal Tool is a very limited malware tool that looks for a relatively few specific items. Windows Defender is full-featured. You can read about each tool at these links and make the comparison yourself:

<P>
infotips<BR>

popups
<P>
It seems that there is so muddled usage of these terms so any explanation of accurate usage would be appreciated.
<P>
JS explained:
<P>
infotips: "they refer to information that can be stored in the VersionInfo resource of Windows executables" as displayed in Windows Explorer. Alternate explanation: Utterly useless information about information you don't want.
<P>
balloon tips: "Windows XP has a "bad habit" to keep on displaying from the taskbar Balloon Tips , showing all kind of (sometimes stupid and annoying ) reminders."
Alternate explanation. That red balloon that floats to top of your screen too fast to read.
<P>
tooltips: "Display a tip when you position the mouse on the Minimize, Maximize, or Close button." Alternate explanation: The monkey wrench you need to fix problems in 
Windows.
<P>
popups: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/web/sp2_popupblocker.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/web/sp2_popupblocker.mspx</A> Alternate explanation: That furry little animal that pops ups out of a hole 
in the middle of your nice green lawn.
