<P>
Greg inquired - Does Defender stop spam? I have Vista Premium with it. I also have Lavasoft Adaware. I ran it awhile ago and found over 60 malicious spams. I kind of 
thought Defender would stop this. 
<P>
Alias answered:<BR>
Another word for Defender is Defenseless. No, it does not stop spam. I thought Windows Mail would do that. If not, check out Thunderbird at <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird">http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird</A>. It does a great job of filtering out spam.
<P><BR>
*** I'm currently using Google Mail combined with Thunderbird. I use Thunderbird to get my mail via POP. For about half a year I hardly had any spam, now however, the spam is increasing. I assume the real pro spammers have got around Google's Thunderbird's anti-spam logic. 
<P>
Mike B. adds:<BR>
SPAM is unsolicited e-mails (junk mail etc). Windows Defender is designed to prevent unauthorized system modifications or the insertion of other malware see:<BR>

Cindy J. wrote - Thanks for your newsletter I really enjoy it. I always find at least one item that helps my in my job which is more than I find in the other newsletters I read. I've noticed from past newsletters that you really like Firefox. What's the next WWW browser that you'd recommend?
<P><BR>
*** I'm currently trying out TheWorld Browser on XP and Vista, only 1.2 meg download. They also have a Win98 Version which doesn't seem to work, at least on my test Win98SE PC. However, I am really impressed with the speed of TheWorld Browser on XP.

<P>
dfpowe asked - I got a  notebook for my daughter with windows vista.  I was trying to add vista to my desk top. but I have trouble with the key. What can I do. Or do I 
have to buy another key.
<P><BR>
*** Best bet is to buy a retail version of Vista and install in on your Desktop PC and use the key supplied.

Tony V. wrote - I've just got this computer and am working with Vista for the first time. So far, so good.  One thing that annoys me though:  when I turn on the CP in 
the morning, instead of it going directly to desktop, it stops and asks me for a password and then continues on to desktop.  My old XP went directly to desktop on start up.  I am the only one who uses this computer and have no need for a password.  How do I turn the feature off?
<P>
Tiberius said:<BR>
1) Go to control panel and user accounts, find your account and remove the password. Or, if you DONT want to remove the password do only the following second step
<P>
2) In the search box after you press start write the following:
<P>
control userpasswords2  and press enter
<P>
There you will uncheck the option that says "users must enter a password"  and press apply, then it will give you a box to enter which use you want to auto- login.
So enter the name, and the passwords if you have retained a password, if you removed the password, just leave it blank
<P>
Malke adds:<BR>
You can set the machine to boot directly to your user accounts' Desktop by clicking on the Start Orb and typing in the Search box (or the Run box if you're using the Classic Start Menu):
<P>
control userpasswords2 [enter]
<P>
Uncheck "users must enter a password.", click Apply. You'll be presented with a box to select the user account to which you want to automatically log onto (yours) and the password. If you didn't assign a password, leave it blank.

<P>
Kolin T. inquired - How do I stop my Vista machine from automatically restarting after Microsoft Updates has run and installed updates automatically?  Is my only option to turn off automatic updating?
<P>
Julian suggested:<BR>
Nope. You have options.
<P>
Control Panel | Windows Update | Change Settings 
<P>
Cal Bear '66" added:<BR>
Set Windows Update to notify you when new updates are available or to download and then notify you to install new updates.
