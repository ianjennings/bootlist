<STRONG><font color="red">1) x64 Or x32 Processor</font></STRONG>
<P>
Squeezy asked - I am about to purchase a new PC and it seems most have x64 bit double processors, but most suppliers offer them with Vista x32.  would it not be better to buy with Vista x64?  Will the x32 version utilize both processors or will one be redundant?
<P>
Qu0ll said:<BR>
Do you mean double processors as in 2 separate CPUs or double as in dual core?  I think you probably mean the latter?  Anyway, Vista 32 will utilize both cores or CPUs as required (as will Vista 64).  The decision between 32-bit or 64-bit is mostly concerned with how much RAM you want.  If you have 4GB+ RAM then you need Vista 64.
<P>
Also note that the 32-bit version of Vista has better driver support in general but, having said that, I am using Vista Ultimate x64 and have not experienced any driver issues at all.
<P>
Mike H. said:<BR>
Unless you have mission critical 64bit programs and the need to run more than 4gb RAM, stay with 32bit Vista.

Memer posted - I'm having problems with the windows vista sidebar. It was working fine then suddenly it stopped working and I can't seem to view the gadgets properly. They appear either as a blank black or white box. Any suggestions on how to fix this problem? Or maybe if there is a way to reinstall the sidebar?
<P>
Ramesh answered:<BR>
This could be due to missing XML registration. See:

ssbaby asked - I installed Acrobat 8 Pro on Vista Home Premium 64x Edition but when I try to use the program it pops up a warning message saying: Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional cannot be launched at this time. You must launch at least one other suite component (such as Adobe Photoshop) before launching Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional.
<P>
Julian said:<BR>
Replace Acrobat with Foxit and be delighted:<BR>

Stuart F. posted - I hope this proves helpful to all.
<P>
We received yesterday via Microsoft Update an updated driver for Realtek RTL8139 series ethernet NIC cards v6.103.126.2007, which we duly accepted, downloaded, reboot etc.
<P>
However we noticed that connection to the internet was slow to say the least and downloads either would not connect or took for ever and a day to receive. Consequently we rolled back the driver to version 6.101.1124.2006 all appears fine again.
<P>
Today we have had 5 customers contact us to say they had an update yesterday and now they either cannot connect or connection is very slow. On investigation we found that they had also had the Realtek download via Microsoft Update and having rolled back the driver in all cases, connections are now back to normal.
<P>
I hope this helps anyone who is now experiencing similar problems.
<P>
Mick said:<BR>
Thanks for that. Microsoft has a BAD habit of mucking around with NIC cards updates; they always have done it. I have a policy with any NIC updates: " if it is working, don't download probs"
<P><BR>
*** It it isn't broke, dont fix it. Dont download/install MS updates for cards that are working just fine.

Seems to be hit or miss; it's a faulty capacitor problem, one may flake out, while another may give years of service:<BR>
